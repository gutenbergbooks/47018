<h2>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>

<p>The First Edition of this work had a rapid sale, and
within a few weeks after it was published the entire
issue passed from the publisher’s shelves into the hands
of the public. A Second Edition, although urgently
called for, was not immediately attempted. The First
had been found incomplete and faulty in many respects,
and the author determined to thoroughly revise and
recast before again going to press. The present edition,
therefore, will be found much more complete than
the First; indeed, I may say that it has been entirely
rewritten, and that, whereas the First contained
but 3,000 words, this gives nearly 5,000, with a mass
of fresh illustrations, and extended articles on the
more important slang terms—<span class="sc lower">HUMBUG</span>, for instance.
The notices of a <i>Lingua Franca</i> element in the language
of London vagabonds is peculiar to this edition.</p>

<p>My best thanks are due to several correspondents
for valuable hints and suggestions as to the probable
etymologies of various colloquial expressions.</p>

<p>One literary journal of high repute recommended a
<a id="page-vi" href="#page-vi" class="pagenum" title="vi"></a>
division of cant from slang; but the annoyance of
two indices in a small work appeared to me to more
than counterbalance the benefit of a stricter philological
classification, so I have for the present adhered
to the old arrangement; indeed, to separate cant from
slang would be almost impossible.</p>

<p>Respecting the <span class="sc lower">HIEROGLYPHICS OF VAGABONDS</span>, I
have been unable to obtain further information; but
the following extract from a popular manual which I
have just met with is worth recording, although,
perhaps, somewhat out of place in a Preface.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Gipseys follow their brethren by numerous marks, such as
strewing handfuls of grass in the day time at a four lane or
cross roads; the grass being strewn down the road the gang
have taken; also, by a cross being made on the ground with a
stick or knife, the longest end of the cross denotes the route
taken. In the night time a cleft stick is placed in the fence at
the cross roads, with an arm pointing down the road their comrades
have taken. The marks are always placed on the left-hand
side, so that the stragglers can easily and readily find them.”—<i>Snowden’s
Magistrate’s Assistant</i>, 1852, p. 444.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h2>

<p>If any gentleman of a studious turn of mind, who may
have acquired the habit of carrying pencils and notebooks,
would for one year reside in Monmouth Court,
Seven Dials; six months in Orchard Street, Westminster;
three months in Mint Street, Borough; and
consent to undergo another three months on the extremely
popular, but very much disliked treadmill
(<i>vulgo</i> the “Everlasting Staircase”), finishing, I will
propose, by a six months’ tramp, in the character of a
cadger and beggar, over England, I have not the least
doubt but that he would be able to write an interesting
work on the languages, secret and vulgar, of the lower
orders.</p>

<p>In the matter of <span class="sc lower">SLANG</span>, our studious friend would
have to divide his time betwixt observation and research.
Conversations on the outsides of omnibuses,
on steamboat piers, or at railway termini, would demand
his most attentive hearing, so would the knots of
semi-decayed cabmen, standing about in bundles of
<a id="page-viii" href="#page-viii" class="pagenum" title="viii"></a>
worn-out great-coats and haybands, betwixt watering
pails, and conversing in a dialect every third word of
which is without home or respectable relations. He
would also have to station himself for hours near
gatherings of ragged boys playing or fighting, but ever
and anon contributing to the note-book a pure street
term. He would have to “hang about” lobbies, mark
the refined word-droppings of magniloquent flunkies,
“run after” all the popular preachers, go to the Inns
of Court, be up all night and about all day—in fact,
be a ubiquitarian, with a note-book and pencil in hand.</p>

<p>As for research, he would have to turn over each
page of our popular literature, wander through all the
weekly serials, wade through the newspapers, fashionable
and unfashionable, and subscribe to Mudie’s, and
scour the novels. This done, and if he has been an
observant man, I will engage to say, that he has made
a choice gathering, and that we may reasonably expect
an interesting little book.</p>

<p>I give this outline of preparatory study to show the
reason the task has never been undertaken before.
People in the present chase after respectability don’t
care to turn blackguards, and exchange cards with the
Whitechapel Pecker or the Sharp’s-alley Chicken, for
the sake of a few vulgar, although curious words; and
we may rest assured that it is quite impossible to write
any account of vulgar or low language, and remain
seated on damask in one’s own drawing room. But a
<a id="page-ix" href="#page-ix" class="pagenum" title="ix"></a>
fortunate circumstance attended the compiler of the
present work, and he has neither been required to reside
in Seven Dials, visit the treadmill, or wander over the
country in the character of a vagabond or a cadger.</p>

<p>In collecting old ballads, penny histories, and other
printed street narratives, as materials for a <i>History of
Cheap or Popular Literature</i>, he frequently had occasion
to purchase in Seven Dials and the Borough a few old
songs or dying speeches, from the chaunters and patterers
who abound in those neighbourhoods. With
some of these men (their names would not in the least
interest the reader, and would only serve the purpose
of making this Preface look like a vulgar page from
the London Directory) an arrangement was made, that
they should collect the cant and slang words used by
the different wandering tribes of London and the
country. Some of these chaunters are men of respectable
education (although filling a vagabond’s
calling), and can write good hands, and express themselves
fluently, if not with orthographical correctness.
To prevent deception and mistakes, the words and
phrases sent in were checked off by other chaunters
and tramps. Assistance was also sought and obtained,
through an intelligent printer in Seven Dials, from the
costermongers in London, and the pedlars and hucksters
who traverse the country. In this manner the
greater number of cant words were procured, very
valuable help being continually derived from <i>Mayhew’s
<a id="page-x" href="#page-x" class="pagenum" title="x"></a>
London Labour and London Poor</i>, a work which had
gone over much of the same ground. The slang and
vulgar expressions were gleaned from every source
which appeared to offer any materials; indeed the
references attached to words in the Dictionary frequently
indicate the channels which afforded them.</p>

<p>Although in the Introduction I have divided cant
from slang, and treated the subjects separately, yet in
the Dictionary I have only, in a few instances, pointed
out which are slang, or which are cant terms. The
task would have been a difficult one. Many words
which were once cant are slang now. The words <span class="sc lower">PRIG</span>
and <span class="sc lower">COVE</span> are instances in point. Once cant and secret
terms, they are now only street vulgarisms.</p>

<p>The etymologies attempted are only given as contributions
to the subject, and the derivation of no vulgar
term is guaranteed. The origin of many street words
will, perhaps, never be discovered, having commenced
with a knot of illiterate persons, and spread amongst
a public that cared not a fig for the history of the
word, so long as it came to their tongues to give a
vulgar piquancy to a joke, or relish to an exceedingly
familiar conversation. The references and authorities
given in italics frequently show only the direction or
probable source of the etymology. The author, to
avoid tedious verbiage, was obliged, in so small a work,
to be curt in his notes and suggestions.</p>

<p>He has to explain also that a few words will, probably,
<a id="page-xi" href="#page-xi" class="pagenum" title="xi"></a>
be noticed in the Slang and Cant Dictionary that
are questionable as coming under either of those designations.
These have been admitted because they
were originally either vulgar terms, or the compiler
had something novel to say concerning them. The
makers of our large dictionaries have been exceedingly
crotchety in their choice of what they considered respectable
words. It is amusing to know that Richardson
used the word <span class="sc lower">HUMBUG</span> to explain the sense of
other words, but omitted it in the alphabetical arrangement
as not sufficiently respectable and ancient. The
word <span class="sc lower">SLANG</span>, too, he served in the same way.</p>

<p>Filthy and obscene words have been carefully excluded,
although street-talk, unlicensed and unwritten,
abounds in these.</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="line">“Immodest words admit of no defence,</div>
  <div class="line">For want of decency is want of sense.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It appears from the calculations of philologists, that
there are 38,000 words in the English language, including
derivations. I believe I have, for the first
time, in consecutive order, added at least 3,000 words
to the previous stock,—vulgar and often very objectionable,
but still terms in every-day use, and employed
by thousands. It is not generally known, that the
polite Lord Chesterfield once desired Dr. Johnson to
compile a Slang Dictionary; indeed, it was Chesterfield,
some say, who first used the word <span class="sc lower">HUMBUG</span>.
<a id="page-xii" href="#page-xii" class="pagenum" title="xii"></a>
Words, like peculiar styles of dress, get into public
favour, and come and go in fashion. When great
favourites and universal they truly become household
words, although generally considered slang, when their
origin or antecedents are inquired into.</p>

<p>A few errors of the press, I am sorry to say, may
be noticed; but, considering the novelty of the subject,
and the fact that no fixed orthography of vulgar
speech exists, it will, I hope, be deemed a not uninteresting
essay on a new and very singular branch of
human inquiry; for, as Mayhew remarks, “the whole
subject of cant and slang is, to the philologist, replete
with interest of the most profound character.”</p>

<p><span class="sc">The compiler will be much obliged by the receipt,
through Mr. Camden Hotten, the publisher,
of any cant, slang, or vulgar words not mentioned
in the dictionary. The probable origin,
or etymology, of any fashionable or unfashionable
vulgarism, will also be received by him
with thanks.</span></p>

<h2 id="chapter-1">THE HISTORY OF CANT,<br />

<span class="subtitle">OR, THE  SECRET LANGUAGE OF VAGABONDS.</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Cant</span> and <span class="sc">Slang</span> are universal and world-wide.</p>

<p>Nearly every nation on the face of the globe,
polite and barbarous, may be divided into two
portions, the stationary and the wandering, the
civilised and the uncivilised, the respectable and
the scoundrel,—those who have fixed abodes and
avail themselves of the refinements of civilisation,
and those who go from place to place picking up
a precarious livelihood by petty sales, begging, or
theft. This peculiarity is to be observed amongst
the heathen tribes of the southern hemisphere, as
well as the oldest and most refined countries of
Europe. As Mayhew very pertinently remarks,
“it would appear, that not only are all races
<a id="page-2" href="#page-2" class="pagenum" title="2"></a>
divisible into wanderers and settlers, but that each
civilised or settled tribe has generally some wandering
horde intermingled with, and in a measure
preying upon it.” In South Africa, the
naked and miserable Hottentots are pestered by
the still more abject <i>Sonquas</i>; and it may be
some satisfaction for us to know that our old
enemies at the Cape, the Kafirs, are troubled with
a tribe of rascals called <i>Fingoes</i>,—the former term,
we are informed by travellers, signifying beggars,
and the latter wanderers and outcasts. In South
America, and among the islands of the Pacific,
matters are pretty much the same. Sleek and fat
rascals, with not much inclination towards honesty,
fatten, or rather fasten, like body insects, upon
other rascals, who would be equally sleek and
fat but for their vagabond dependents. Luckily
for respectable persons, however, vagabonds, both
at home and abroad, show certain outward peculiarities
which distinguish them from the great
mass of lawful people off whom they feed and
fatten. Personal observation, and a little research
into books, enable me to mark these external
traits. The wandering races are remarkable for the
development of the bones of the face, as the jaws,
cheek-bones, &amp;c., high crowned, stubborn-shaped
heads, quick restless eyes,<a class="marker" id="marker-1" href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a> and hands nervously
<a id="page-3" href="#page-3" class="pagenum" title="3"></a>
itching to be doing;<a class="marker" id="marker-2" href="#footnote-2"><sup>2</sup></a> for their love of gambling,—staking
their very existence upon a single cast;
for sensuality of all kinds; <i>and for their use of a
<span class="sc lower">CANT</span> language with which to conceal their designs
and plunderings</i>.</p>

<p>The secret jargon, or rude speech, of the vagabonds
who hang upon the Hottentots is termed <i>cuze-cat</i>.
In Finland, the fellows who steal seal skins, pick
the pockets of bear-skin overcoats, and talk Cant,
are termed Lappes. In France, the secret language
of highwaymen, housebreakers, and pickpockets is
named <i>Argot</i>. The brigands and more romantic
rascals of Spain, term their private tongue <i>Germania</i>,
or Robbers’ Language. <i>Rothwalsch</i>, or Red
Italian, is synonymous with Cant and thieves’ talk
in Germany. The vulgar dialect of Malta, and the
Scala towns of the Levant—imported into this
country and incorporated with English cant—is
known as the <i>Lingua Franca</i>, or bastard Italian.
And the crowds of lazy beggars that infest the
streets of Naples and Rome, and the brigands that
Albert Smith used to describe near Pompeii—stopping
a railway train, and deliberately rifling the
pockets and baggage of the passengers—their secret
language is termed <i>Gergo</i>. In England, as we all
know, it is called <i>Cant</i>—often improperly <i>Slang</i>.</p>

<p>Most nations, then, may boast, or rather lament,
<a id="page-4" href="#page-4" class="pagenum" title="4"></a>
a vulgar tongue, formed principally from the
national language, the hereditary property of
thieves, tramps, and beggars,—the pests of civilised
communities. The formation of these secret tongues
vary, of course, with the circumstances surrounding
the speakers. A writer in <i>Notes and Queries</i>,<a class="marker" id="marker-3" href="#footnote-3"><sup>3</sup></a> has
well remarked, that “the investigation of the origin
and principles of Cant and Slang language opens a
curious field of enquiry, replete with considerable
interest to the philologist and the philosopher. It
affords a remarkable instance of lingual contrivance,
which, without the introduction of much
arbitrary matter, has developed a system of communicating
ideas, having all the advantages of a
foreign language.”</p>

<p>An inquiry into the etymology of foreign vulgar
secret tongues, and their analogy with that spoken
in England, would be curious and interesting in
the extreme, but neither present space nor personal
acquirements permit of the task, and therefore the
writer confines himself to a short account of the
origin of English Cant.</p>

<p>The terms <span class="sc lower">CANT</span> and <span class="sc lower">CANTING</span> were doubtless
derived from <i>chaunt</i> or <i>chaunting</i>,—the “whining
tone, or modulation of voice adopted by beggars,
with intent to coax, wheedle, or cajole by pretensions
<a id="page-5" href="#page-5" class="pagenum" title="5"></a>
of wretchedness.”<a class="marker" id="marker-4" href="#footnote-4"><sup>4</sup></a> For the origin of
the other application of the word <span class="sc lower">CANT</span>, pulpit
hypocrisy, we are indebted to a pleasant page
in the Spectator (No. 147):—“<i>Cant</i> is by
some people derived from one Andrew Cant,
who, they say, was a Presbyterian minister in
some illiterate part of Scotland, who by exercise
and use had obtained the faculty, alias gift, of
talking in the pulpit in such a dialect that ’tis
said he was understood by none but his own
congregation,—and not by all of them. Since
Master <i>Cant’s</i> time it has been understood in
a larger sense, and signifies all exclamations,
whinings, unusual tones, and, in fine, all praying
and preaching like the unlearned of the Presbyterians.”
This anecdote is curious, if it is not
correct. It was the custom in Addison’s time
to have a fling at the blue Presbyterians, and the
mention made by <i>Whitelocke</i> of Andrew Cant,
a fanatical Scotch preacher, and the squib upon
the same worthy, in <i>Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence
Displayed</i>, may probably have started the whimsical
etymology. As far as we are concerned,
however, in the present inquiry, <span class="sc lower">CANT</span> was derived
from <i>chaunt</i>, a beggar’s whine; <span class="sc lower">CHAUNTING</span> being
the recognised term amongst beggars to this day
for begging orations and street whinings; and
<span class="sc lower">CHAUNTER</span>, a street talker and tramp, the very
term still used by strollers and patterers. The use
<a id="page-6" href="#page-6" class="pagenum" title="6"></a>
of the word <span class="sc lower">CANT</span>, amongst beggars, must certainly
have commenced at a very early date, for we find
“<span class="sc lower">TO CANTE</span>, to speake,” in Harman’s list of
Rogues’ Words in the year 1566; and Harrison
about the same time,<a class="marker" id="marker-5" href="#footnote-5"><sup>5</sup></a> in speaking of beggars and
Gipseys, says, “they have devised a language among
themselves which they name <span class="sc lower">CANTING</span>, but others
Pedlars’ Frenche.”</p>

<p>Now the word <span class="sc lower">CANT</span> in its old sense, and <span class="sc lower">SLANG</span><a class="marker" id="marker-6" href="#footnote-6"><sup>6</sup></a>
in its modern application, although used by good
writers and persons of education as synonymes, are
in reality quite distinct and separate terms. <span class="sc">Cant</span>,
apart from religious hypocrisy, refers to the old
secret language, by allegory or distinct terms, of
Gipseys, thieves, tramps, and beggars. <span class="sc">Slang</span>
represents that evanescent, vulgar language, ever
changing with fashion and taste, which has principally
come into vogue during the last seventy or
eighty years, spoken by persons in every grade of
life, rich and poor, honest and dishonest.<a class="marker" id="marker-7" href="#footnote-7"><sup>7</sup></a> <span class="sc">Cant</span>
<a id="page-7" href="#page-7" class="pagenum" title="7"></a>
is old; <span class="sc">Slang</span> is always modern and changing. To
illustrate the difference: a thief in <i>Cant</i> language
would term a horse a <span class="sc lower">PRANCER</span> or a <span class="sc lower">PRAD</span>,—while
in <i>slang</i>, a man of fashion would speak of it as a
<span class="sc lower">BIT OF BLOOD</span>, or a <span class="sc lower">SPANKER</span>, or a <span class="sc lower">NEAT TIT</span>.
A handkerchief, too, would be a <span class="sc lower">BILLY</span>, a <span class="sc lower">FOGLE</span>,
or a <span class="sc lower">KENT RAG</span>, in the secret language of low
characters,—whilst amongst vulgar persons, or
those who aped their speech, it would be called a
<span class="sc lower">RAG</span>, a <span class="sc lower">WIPE</span>, or a <span class="sc lower">CLOUT</span>. <span class="sc">Cant</span> was formed for
purposes of secrecy. <span class="sc">Slang</span> is indulged in from a
desire to appear familiar with life, gaiety, town-humour,
and with the transient nick names and
street jokes of the day. Both Cant and Slang, I
am aware, are often huddled together as synonymes,
but they are distinct terms, and as such should be
used.</p>

<p>To the Gipseys, beggars and thieves are undoubtedly
indebted for their Cant language. The Gipseys
landed in this country early in the reign of Henry
the Eighth. They were at first treated as conjurors
and magicians,—indeed they were hailed by the
populace with as much applause as a company of
English theatricals usually receive on arriving in a
distant colony. They came here with all their old
Eastern arts of palmistry, fortune-telling, doubling
money by incantation and burial,—shreds of pagan
idolatry; and they brought with them, also, the
dishonesty of the lower caste of Asiatics, and the
vagabondism they had acquired since leaving their
<a id="page-8" href="#page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>
ancient dwelling places in the East, many centuries
before. They possessed, also, a <i>language</i> quite
distinct from anything that had been heard in
England, and they claimed the title of Egyptians,
and as such, when their thievish wandering propensities
became a public nuisance, were cautioned
and proscribed in a royal proclamation by Henry
VIII.<a class="marker" id="marker-8" href="#footnote-8"><sup>8</sup></a> The Gipseys were not long in the country
before they found native imitators. Vagabondism
is peculiarly catching. The idle, the vagrant, and
the criminal outcasts of society, caught an idea
from the so called Egyptians—soon corrupted to
Gipseys. They learned from them how to tramp,
sleep under hedges and trees, to tell fortunes, and
find stolen property for a consideration—frequently,
as the saying runs, before it was lost. They also
learned the value and application of a <i>secret tongue</i>,
indeed all the accompaniments of maunding and
imposture, except thieving and begging, which
were well known in this country long before the
Gipseys paid it a visit,—perhaps the only negative
good that can be said in their favour.</p>

<p><i>Harman</i>, in the year 1566, wrote a singular, not
to say droll book, entitled, <i>A Caveat for commen
Cvrsetors, vulgarley called Vagabones, newly augmented
and inlarged</i>, wherein the history and various
descriptions of rogues and vagabonds are given,
together with their canting tongue. This book,
<a id="page-9" href="#page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>
the earliest of the kind, gives the singular fact
that within a dozen years after the landing of
the Gipseys, companies of English vagrants were
formed, places of meeting appointed, districts for
plunder and begging operations marked out, and
rules agreed to for their common management.
In some cases Gipseys joined the English gangs, in
others English vagrants joined the Gipseys. The
fellowship was found convenient and profitable, as
both parties were aliens to the laws and customs of
the country, living in a great measure in the open
air, apart from the lawful public, and often meeting
each other on the same bye-path, or in the same
retired valley;—but seldom intermarrying, and
entirely adopting each other’s habits. The common
people, too, soon began to consider them as of one
family,—all rogues, and from Egypt. The secret
language spoken by the Gipseys, principally Hindoo
and extremely barbarous to English ears, was
found incomprehensible and very difficult to learn.
The Gipseys, also, found the same difficulty with
the English language. A rude, rough, and most
singular compromise was made, and a mixture of
Gipsey, Old English, newly-coined words, and
cribbings from any foreign, and therefore secret
language, mixed and jumbled together, formed
what has ever since been known as the <span class="sc lower">CANTING
LANGUAGE</span>, or <span class="sc lower">PEDLER’S FRENCH</span>; or, during
the past century, <span class="sc lower">ST. GILES’ GREEK</span>.</p>
<a id="page-10" href="#page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>

<p>Such was the origin of <span class="sc lower">CANT</span>; and in illustration
of its blending with the Gipsey or Cingari
tongue, dusky and Oriental from the sunny plains
of Central Asia, I am enabled to give the accompanying
list of Gipsey, and often Hindoo words,
with, in many instances, their English adoptions.</p>

<p>Here then we have the remarkable fact of several
words of pure Gipsey and Asiatic origin going
the round of Europe, passing into this country
before the Reformation, and coming down to
<a id="page-12" href="#page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
us through numerous generations purely in the
mouths of the people. They have seldom been
written or used in books, and simply as vulgarisms
have they reached our time. Only a few are now
cant, and some are household words. The word
<span class="sc lower">JOCKEY</span>, as applied to a dealer or rider of horses,
came from the Gipsey, and means in that language
a whip. Our standard dictionaries give, of course,
none but conjectural etymologies. Another word,
<span class="sc lower">BAMBOOZLE</span>, has been a sore difficulty with lexicographers.
It is not in the old dictionaries,
although extensively used in familiar or popular
language for the last two centuries; in fact, the
very word that Swift, Butler, L’Estrange, and
Arbuthnot would pick out at once as a telling and
most serviceable term. It is, as we have seen, from
the Gipsey; and here I must state that it was
Boucher who first drew attention to the fact,
although in his remarks on the dusky tongue, he
has made a ridiculous mistake by concluding it to
be identical with its offspring, <span class="sc lower">CANT</span>. Other
parallel instances, with but slight variations from
the old Gipsey meanings, could be mentioned, but
sufficient examples have been adduced to show
that Marsden, the great Oriental scholar in the
last century, when he declared before the Society
of Antiquaries that the Cant of English thieves
and beggars had nothing to do with the language
spoken by the despised Gipseys, was in error. Had
<a id="page-13" href="#page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
the Gipsey tongue been analysed and committed to
writing three centuries ago, there is every probability
that many scores of words now in common
use could be at once traced to its source. Instances
continually occur now-a-days of street vulgarisms
ascending to the drawing-rooms of respectable
society. Why, then, may not the Gipsey-vagabond
alliance three centuries ago have contributed its
quota of common words to popular speech?</p>

<p>I feel confident there is a Gipsey element in the
English language hitherto unrecognised; slender it
may be, but not, therefore, unimportant.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” says Moore the poet, in a humorous
little book, <i>Tom Crib’s Memorial to Congress</i>, 1819,
“the Gipsey language, with the exception of such
terms as relate to their own peculiar customs, differs
but little from the regular Flash or Cant language.”
But this was magnifying the importance
of the alliance. Moore knew nothing of the
Gipsey tongue other than the few Cant words put
into the mouths of the beggars, in <i>Beaumont and
Fletcher’s Comedy of the Beggar’s Bush</i>, and <i>Ben
Jonson’s Masque of the Gipseys Metamorphosed</i>,—hence
his confounding Cant with Gipsey speech,
and appealing to the Glossary of Cant for so called
“Gipsey” words at the end of the <i>Life of Bamfylde
Moore Carew</i>, to bear him out in his assertion.
Still his remark bears much truth, and proof
would have been found long ago if any scholar
<a id="page-14" href="#page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
had taken the trouble to examine the “barbarous
jargon of Cant,” and to have compared it with
Gipsey speech. As George Borrow, in his <i>Account
of the Gipseys in Spain</i>, eloquently concludes his
second volume, speaking of the connection of the
Gipseys with Europeans:—“Yet from this temporary
association were produced two results: European
fraud became sharpened by coming into contact
with Asiatic craft; whilst European tongues,
by imperceptible degrees, became recruited with
various words (some of them wonderfully expressive),
many of which have long been stumbling-blocks
to the philologist, who, whilst stigmatising
them as words of mere vulgar invention, or of unknown
origin, has been far from dreaming that a
little more research or reflection would have proved
their affinity to the Sclavonic, Persian, or Romaic,
or perhaps to the mysterious object of his veneration,
the Sanscrit, the sacred tongue of the palm-covered
regions of Ind; words originally introduced
into Europe by objects too miserable to occupy for
a moment his lettered attention,—the despised denizens
of the tents of Roma.”</p>

<p>But the Gipseys, their speech, their character—bad
enough as all the world testifies—their history
and their religious belief, have been totally disregarded,
and their poor persons buffeted and jostled
about until it is a wonder that any trace of origin
or national speech exists in them. On the continent
<a id="page-15" href="#page-15" class="pagenum" title="15"></a>
they received better attention at the hands
of learned men. Their language was taken
down, their history traced, and their extraordinary
customs and practice of living in the open air,
and eating raw or putrid meat, explained. They
ate reptiles and told fortunes, because they had
learnt it through their forefathers centuries back
in Hindostan, and they devoured carrion because
the Hindoo proverb—“<i>that which God kills is
better than that killed by man</i>,”<a class="marker" id="marker-11" href="#footnote-11"><sup>11</sup></a>—was still in
their remembrance. Grellman, a learned German,
was their principal historian, and to him we are
almost entirely indebted for the little we know of
their language.<a class="marker" id="marker-12" href="#footnote-12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="sc">Gipsey</span> then started, and partially merged into
<span class="sc lower">CANT</span>, and the old story told by Harrison and
others, that the first inventor of canting was
hanged for his pains, would seem to be a fable, for
jargon as it is, it was, doubtless, of gradual formation,
like all other languages or systems of speech.
The Gipseys at the present day all know the <i>old
cant</i> words, as well as their own tongue,—or
rather what remains of it. As Borrow states, “the
dialect of the English Gipseys is mixed with English
words.”<a class="marker" id="marker-13" href="#footnote-13"><sup>13</sup></a> Those of the tribe who frequent fairs,
<a id="page-16" href="#page-16" class="pagenum" title="16"></a>
and mix with English tramps, readily learn the
new words, as they are adopted by what Harman
calls, “the fraternity of vagabonds.” Indeed, the
old <span class="sc lower">CANT</span> is a common language to vagrants of all
descriptions and origin scattered over the British
Isles.</p>

<p>Ancient English <span class="sc lower">CANT</span> has considerably altered
since the first dictionary was compiled by Harman,
in 1566. A great many words are unknown in
the present tramps’ and thieves’ vernacular. Some
of them, however, bear still their old definitions,
while others have adopted fresh meanings,—to
escape detection, I suppose. “<span class="sc">Abraham man</span>” is
yet seen in our modern <span class="sc lower">SHAM ABRAHAM</span>, or <span class="sc lower">PLAY
THE OLD SOLDIER</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, to feign sickness or distress.
“<span class="sc">Autum</span>” is still a church or chapel
amongst Gipseys; and “<span class="sc lower">BECK</span>,” a constable, is our
modern cant and slang <span class="sc lower">BEEK</span>, a policeman or magistrate.
“<span class="sc">Bene</span>,” or <span class="sc lower">BONE</span>, stands for <i>good</i> in
Seven Dials, and the back streets of Westminster;
and “<span class="sc lower">BOWSE</span>” is our modern <span class="sc lower">BOOZE</span>, to drink or
fuddle. A “<span class="sc lower">BOWSING KEN</span>” was the old cant
term for a public house, and <span class="sc lower">BOOZING KEN</span>, in
modern cant, has precisely the same meaning.
“<span class="sc">Bufe</span>” was then the term for a dog, now it is
<span class="sc lower">BUFFER</span>,—frequently applied to men. “<span class="sc">Cassan</span>”
is both old and modern cant for cheese; the same
may be said of “<span class="sc lower">CHATTES</span>” or <span class="sc lower">CHATTS</span>, the
gallows. “<span class="sc">Cofe</span>,” or <span class="sc lower">COVE</span>, is still the vulgar
<a id="page-17" href="#page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
synonyme for a man. “<span class="sc">Drawers</span>” was hose, or
“hosen,”—now applied to the lining for trousers.
“<span class="sc">Dudes</span>” was cant for clothes, we now say
<span class="sc lower">DUDDS</span>. “<span class="sc">Flag</span>” is still a fourpenny piece; and
“<span class="sc lower">FYLCHE</span>” means to rob. “<span class="sc">Ken</span>” is a house,
and “<span class="sc lower">LICK</span>” means to thrash; “<span class="sc lower">PRANCER</span>” is yet
known amongst rogues as a horse; and “to <span class="sc lower">PRIG</span>,”
amongst high and low, is to steal. Three centuries
ago, if one beggar said anything disagreeable to
another, the person annoyed would say “<span class="sc lower">STOW
YOU</span>,” or hold your peace; low people now say
<span class="sc lower">STOW IT</span>, equivalent to “be quiet.” “<span class="sc">Trine</span>” is
still to hang; “<span class="sc lower">WYN</span>” yet stands for a penny.
And many other words, as will be seen in the
glossary, still retain their ancient meaning.</p>

<p>As specimens of those words which have altered
their original cant signification, I may instance
“<span class="sc lower">CHETE</span>,” now written <span class="sc lower">CHEAT</span>. <span class="sc">Chete</span> was in
ancient cant what <i>chop</i> is in the Canton-Chinese,—an
almost inseparable adjunct. Everything
was termed a <span class="sc lower">CHETE</span>, and qualified by a substantive-adjective,
which showed what kind of a
<span class="sc lower">CHETE</span> was meant; for instance, “<span class="sc lower">CRASHING
CHETES</span>” were teeth; a “<span class="sc lower">MOFFLING CHETE</span>,” a
napkin; a “<span class="sc lower">GRUNTING CHETE</span>,” a pig, &amp;c. &amp;c.
<span class="sc">Cheat</span> now-a-days means to defraud or swindle,
and lexicographers have tortured etymology for an
original—but without success. <i>Escheats</i> and <i>escheatours</i>
have been named, but with great doubts;
<a id="page-18" href="#page-18" class="pagenum" title="18"></a>
indeed, Stevens, the learned commentator on
Shakespere, acknowledged that he “did not recollect
to have met with the word <i>cheat</i> in our ancient
writers.”<a class="marker" id="marker-14" href="#footnote-14"><sup>14</sup></a> <span class="sc">Cheat</span>, to defraud, then, is no other
than an old Cant term, somewhat altered in its
meaning,<a class="marker" id="marker-15" href="#footnote-15"><sup>15</sup></a> and as such it should be described in
the next Etymological Dictionary. Another instance
of a change in the meaning of the old Cant,
but the retention of the word is seen in “<span class="sc lower">CLY</span>,”
formerly to take or steal, now a pocket;—remembering
a certain class of low characters, a curious
connection between the two meanings will be discovered.
“<span class="sc">Make</span>” was a halfpenny, we now say
<span class="sc lower">MAG</span>,—<span class="sc lower">MAKE</span> being modern Cant for appropriating,—“convey
the wise it call.” “<span class="sc">Milling</span>”
stood for stealing, it is now a pugilistic term for
fighting or beating. “<span class="sc">Nab</span>” was a head,—low
people now say <span class="sc lower">NOB</span>, the former meaning, in
modern Cant, to steal or seize. “<span class="sc">Pek</span>” was
meat,—we still say <span class="sc lower">PECKISH</span>, when hungry.
“<span class="sc">Prygges</span>, <i>dronken Tinkers or beastly people</i>,” as
old Harman wrote, would scarcely be understood
now; a <span class="sc lower">PRIG</span>, in the 19th century, is a pickpocket
or thief. “<span class="sc">Quier</span>,” or <span class="sc lower">QUEER</span>, like <i>cheat</i>,
was a very common prefix, and meant bad or
<a id="page-19" href="#page-19" class="pagenum" title="19"></a>
wicked,—it now means odd, curious, or strange;
but to the ancient cant we are indebted for
the word, which etymologists should remember.<a class="marker" id="marker-16" href="#footnote-16"><sup>16</sup></a>
“<span class="sc">Rome</span>,” or <span class="sc lower">RUM</span>, formerly meant good, or of the
first quality, and was extensively used like <i>cheat</i>
and <i>queer</i>,—indeed as an adjective it was the opposite
of the latter. <span class="sc">Rum</span> now means curious, and is
synonymous with queer, thus,—a “<span class="sc lower">RUMMY</span> old
fellow,” or a “<span class="sc lower">QUEER</span> old man.” Here again we
see the origin of an every day word, scouted by
lexicographers and snubbed by respectable persons,
but still a word of frequent and popular use.
“<span class="sc">Yannam</span>” meant bread, <span class="sc lower">PANNUM</span> is the word
now. Other instances could be pointed out, but
they will be observed in the dictionary.</p>

<p>Several words are entirely obsolete. “<span class="sc">Alybbeg</span>”
no longer means a bed, nor “<span class="sc lower">ASKEW</span>” a cup.
“<span class="sc">Booget</span>,”<a class="marker" id="marker-17" href="#footnote-17"><sup>17</sup></a> now-a-days, would not be understood
for a basket; neither would “<span class="sc lower">GAN</span>” pass current
for mouth. “<span class="sc">Fullams</span>” was the old cant term for
false or loaded dice, and although used by Shakespere
<a id="page-20" href="#page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
in this sense, is now unknown and obsolete.
Indeed, as Tom Moore somewhere remarks, the
present Greeks of St. Giles, themselves, would be
thoroughly puzzled by many of the ancient canting
songs,—taking for example, the first verse of an
old favourite:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="line">Bing out, bien Morts, and toure and toure,</div>
  <div class="line i2">Bing out, bien Morts, and toure;</div>
  <div class="line">For all your duds are bing’d awast;</div>
  <div class="line i2">The bien cove hath the loure.<a class="marker" id="marker-18" href="#footnote-18"><sup>18</sup></a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But I think I cannot do better than present to
the reader at once an entire copy of the first
Canting Dictionary ever compiled. As before
mentioned, it was the work of one Thos. Harman,
a gentleman who lived in the days of Queen
Elizabeth. Some writers have remarked that
Decker<a class="marker" id="marker-19" href="#footnote-19"><sup>19</sup></a> was the first to compile a Dictionary of
the vagabonds’ tongue; whilst Borrow,<a class="marker" id="marker-20" href="#footnote-20"><sup>20</sup></a> and Moore,
the poet, stated that Richard Head performed that
<a id="page-21" href="#page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>
service in his <i>Life of an English Rogue</i>, published
in the year 1680. All these statements are equally
incorrect, for the first attempt was made more than
a century before the latter work was issued. The
quaint spelling and old-fashioned phraseology are
preserved, and the reader will quickly detect many
vulgar street words, old acquaintances, dressed in
antique garb.<a class="marker" id="marker-21" href="#footnote-21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

  whether ever he was ‘<i>stalled to the roge</i>’ or no. If he say he

  And if he be not learnedly able to show him the whole

  either of his best garment, if it be worth any money, and
  haue him to the bowsing ken: which is, to some typpling

  that from henceforth it shall be lawfull for thee to cant,
  that is to aske or begge for thi liuiug in al places.” Something
  like this treatment is the popular idea of Freemasonry,
  and what schoolboys term “freeing.”]<!--TN: added closing bracket--></li>

  <li><i>WAPPING</i> [coition].</li>

</ul>

<p>Turning our attention more to the Cant of
modern times, in connection with the old, we find
that words have been drawn into the thieves’
vocabulary from every conceivable source. Hard
or infrequent words, vulgarly termed <i>crack-jaw</i>, or
<i>jaw-breakers</i>, were very often used and considered
as cant terms. And here it should be mentioned
that at the present day the most inconsistent and
far-fetched terms are often used for secret purposes,
when they are known to be caviare to the million.
<a id="page-27" href="#page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
It is really laughable to know that such words as
<i>incongruous</i>, <i>insipid</i>, <i>interloper</i>, <i>intriguing</i>, <i>indecorum</i>,
<i>forestal</i>, <i>equip</i>, <i>hush</i>, <i>grapple</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c., were
current Cant words a century and a half ago; but
such was the case, as any one may see in the
<i>Dictionary of Canting Words</i>, at the end of <i>Bacchus
and Venus</i>,<a class="marker" id="marker-22" href="#footnote-22"><sup>22</sup></a> 1737. They are inserted not as
jokes or squibs, but as selections from the veritable
pocket dictionaries of the Jack Sheppards and
Dick Turpins of the day. If they were safely used
as unknown and cabalistic terms amongst the
commonalty, the fact would form a very curious
illustration of the ignorance of our poor ancestors.
One piece of information is conveyed to us, <i>i.e.</i>,
that the “Knights” or “Gentlemen of the road,”
using these polite words in those days of highwaymen,
were really well educated men,—which
heretofore has always been a hard point of belief,
notwithstanding old novels and operas.</p>

<p>Amongst those Cant words which have either
altered their meaning, or have become extinct, I
may cite <span class="sc lower">LADY</span>, formerly the Cant for “a very
crooked, deformed, and ill-shapen woman;”<a class="marker" id="marker-23" href="#footnote-23"><sup>23</sup></a> and
<a id="page-28" href="#page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"></a>
<span class="sc lower">HARMAN</span>, “a pair of stocks, or a constable.”
The former is a pleasant piece of satire, whilst the
latter indicates a singular method of revenge.
<span class="sc">Harman</span> was the first author who specially wrote
against English vagabonds, and for his trouble his
name became synonymous with a pair of stocks,
and a policeman of the olden time.</p>

<p>Apart from the Gipsey element, we find that
Cant abounds in terms from foreign languages,
and that it exhibits the growth of most recognised
and completely formed tongues,—the gathering of
words from foreign sources. In the reign of Elizabeth
and of King James I., several Dutch, Spanish,
and Flemish words were introduced by soldiers
who had served in the Low Countries, and sailors
who had returned from the Spanish Main, who
like “mine ancient Pistol” were fond of garnishing
their speech with outlandish phrases. Many of
these were soon picked up and adopted by vagabonds
and tramps in their Cant language. The Anglo-Norman
and the Anglo-Saxon, the Scotch, the
French, the Italian, and even the classic languages
of ancient Italy and Greece, have contributed
to its list of words,—besides the various
provincial dialects of England. Indeed, as Mayhew
remarks, English Cant seems to be formed on
the same basis as the <i>Argot</i> of the French, and
the <i>Roth-Spræc</i> of the Germans,—partly metaphorical,
and partly by the introduction of such
<a id="page-29" href="#page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
corrupted foreign terms as are likely to be unknown
to the society amid which the Cant speakers
exist. <span class="sc">Argot</span> is the London thieves’ word for their
secret language,—it is, of course, from the French,
but that matters not so long as it is incomprehensible
to the police and the mob. <span class="sc">Booze</span>, or <span class="sc lower">BOUSE</span>,
I am reminded by a friendly correspondent, comes
from the Dutch, <span class="sc lower">BUYSEN</span>. <span class="sc">Domine</span>, a parson, is
from the Latin; and <span class="sc lower">DON</span>, a clever fellow, has been
filched from the Spanish. <span class="sc">Donna and feeles</span>,
a woman and children, is from the Lingua Franca,
or bastard Italian, although it sounds like an odd
mixture of Spanish and French; whilst <span class="sc lower">DUDDS</span>, the
vulgar term for clothes, may have been pilfered
either from the Gaelic or the Dutch. <span class="sc">Feele</span>, a
daughter, from the French; and <span class="sc lower">FROW</span>, a girl or
wife, from the German—are common tramps’ terms.
So are <span class="sc lower">GENT</span>, silver, from the French, <i>Argent</i>;
and <span class="sc lower">VIAL</span>, a country town, also from the French.
<span class="sc">Horrid-horn</span>, a fool, is believed to be from the
Erse; and <span class="sc lower">GLOAK</span>, a man, from the Scotch. As
stated before, the Dictionary will supply numerous
other instances.</p>

<p>There is one source, however, of secret street
terms, which, in the first edition of this work, was
entirely overlooked,—indeed, it was unknown to
the editor until pointed out by a friendly correspondent,—the
<i>Lingua Franca</i>, or bastard Italian,
spoken at Genoa, Trieste, Malta, Constantinople,
<a id="page-30" href="#page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
Smyrna, Alexandria, and all Mediterranean seaport
towns. The ingredients of this imported Cant
are many. Its foundation is Italian, with a mixture
of modern Greek, German (from the Austrian ports),
Spanish, Turkish, and French. It has been introduced
to the notice of the London wandering tribes
by the sailors, foreign and English, who trade to
and from the Mediterranean seaports, by the
swarms of organ players from all parts of Italy,
and by the makers of images from Rome and
Florence,—all of whom, in dense thoroughfares,
mingle with our lower orders. It would occupy
too much space here to give a list of these words.
They are all noted in the Dictionary.</p>

<p>“There are several Hebrew terms in our Cant
language, obtained, it would appear, from the
intercourse of the thieves with the Jew <i>fences</i>
(receivers of stolen goods); many of the Cant
terms, again, are Sanscrit, got from the Gipseys;
many Latin, got by the beggars from the Catholic
prayers before the Reformation; and many, again,
Italian, got from the wandering musicians and
others; indeed the showmen have but lately introduced
a number of Italian phrases into their Cant
language.”<a class="marker" id="marker-24" href="#footnote-24"><sup>24</sup></a> The Hindostanèe also contributes
several words, and these have been introduced by
the Lascar sailors, who come over here in the East
<a id="page-31" href="#page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
Indiamen, and lodge during their stay in the low
tramps’ lodging houses at the East end of London.
Speaking of the learned tongues, I may mention
that, precarious and abandoned as the vagabond’s
existence is, many persons of classical or refined
education have from time to time joined the ranks,—occasionally
from inclination, as in the popular
instance of Bamfylde Moore Carew, but generally
through indiscretion, and loss of character.<a class="marker" id="marker-25" href="#footnote-25"><sup>25</sup></a> This
will in some measure account for numerous classical
and learned words figuring as Cant terms in the
vulgar Dictionary.</p>

<p>In the early part of the last century, when highwaymen
were by all accounts so plentiful, a great
many new words were added to the canting vocabulary,
whilst several old terms fell into disuse.
<span class="sc">Cant</span>, for instance, as applied to thieves’ talk, was
supplanted by the word <span class="sc lower">FLASH</span>.</p>

<p>A singular feature, however, in vulgar language,
is the retention and the revival of sterling old
English words, long since laid up in ancient manuscripts,
or the subject of dispute among learned
antiquaries. Disraeli somewhere says, “the purest
source of <i>neology</i> is in the revival of <i>old words</i>”—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Words that wise Bacon or brave Rawleigh spake,”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="continue"><a id="page-32" href="#page-32" class="pagenum" title="32"></a>
and Dr. Latham honours our subject by remarking
that “the thieves of London are the conservators
of Anglo-Saxonisms.” Mayhew, too, in his interesting
work, <i>London Labour and London Poor</i>,
admits that many Cant and Slang phrases are
merely old English terms, which have become obsolete
through the caprices of fashion.<!--TN: deleted extraneous quotation mark--> And the
reader who looks into the Dictionary of the vagabonds’
lingo, will see at a glance that these gentlemen
were quite correct, and that we are compelled
to acknowledge the singular truth that a great
many old words, once respectable, and in the
mouths of kings and fine ladies, are now only so
many signals for shrugs and shudders amongst
exceedingly polite people. A Belgravian gentleman
who had lost his watch or his pocket-handkerchief,
would scarcely remark to his mamma that it had
been <span class="sc lower">BONED</span>—yet <span class="sc lower">BONE</span>, in old times, meant to
steal amongst high and low. And a young lady
living in the precincts of dingy, but aristocratic
May-Fair, although enraptured with a Jenny Lind
or a Ristori, would hardly think of turning back in
the box to inform papa that she, Ristori or Lind,
“made no <span class="sc lower">BONES</span> of it”—yet the phrase was most
respectable and well-to-do, before it met with a
change of circumstances. “A <span class="sc lower">CRACK</span> article,”
however first-rate, would, as far as speech is concerned,
have greatly displeased Dr. Johnson and
Mr. Walker—yet both <span class="sc lower">CRACK</span>, in the sense of excellent,
<a id="page-33" href="#page-33" class="pagenum" title="33"></a>
and <span class="sc lower">CRACK UP</span>, to boast or praise, were not
considered vulgarisms in the time of Henry VIII.
<span class="sc">Dodge</span>, a cunning trick, is from the Anglo-Saxon;
and ancient nobles used to “get each other’s
<span class="sc lower">DANDER UP</span>” before appealing to their swords,—quite
<span class="sc lower">FLABERGASTING</span> (also a respectable old word)
the half score of lookers-on with the thumps and
cuts of their heavy weapons. <span class="sc">Gallavanting</span>,
waiting upon the ladies, was as polite in expression
as in action; whilst a clergyman at Paule’s Crosse,
thought nothing of bidding a noisy hearer to “hold
his <span class="sc lower">GAB</span>,” or “shut up his <span class="sc lower">GOB</span>.” <span class="sc">Gadding</span>, roaming
about in an idle and trapesing manner, was
used in an old translation of the Bible; and “to do
anything <span class="sc lower">GINGERLY</span>” was to do it with great care.
Persons of modern tastes will be shocked to know
that the great Lord Bacon spoke of the lower part
of a man’s face as his <span class="sc lower">GILLS</span>.</p>

<p>Shakespere, or as the French say, “the divine
William,” also used many words which are now
counted as dreadfully vulgar. “<span class="sc">Clean</span> gone,” in
the sense of out of sight, or entirely away; “you
took me all <span class="sc lower">A-MORT</span>,” or confounded me; “it won’t
<span class="sc lower">FADGE</span>,” or suit, are phrases taken at random
from the great dramatist’s works. A London
costermonger, or inhabitant of the streets, instead
of saying “I’ll make him yield,” or “give
in,” in a fight or contest, would say, “I’ll make
him <span class="sc lower">BUCKLE</span> under.” Shakespere, in his <i>Henry the
<a id="page-34" href="#page-34" class="pagenum" title="34"></a>
Fourth</i> (Part 2, Act i., Scene 1) has the word, and
Mr. Halliwell, one of the greatest and most industrious
of living antiquaries, informs us, that “the
commentators do not supply another example.”
How strange, then, that the Bard of Avon, and
the Cockney costermongers, should be joint partners
and sole proprietors of the vulgarism. If Shakespere
was not a pugilist, he certainly anticipated
the terms of the prize ring—or they were respectable
words before the prize ring was thought of—for
he has <span class="sc lower">PAY</span>, to beat or thrash, and <span class="sc lower">PEPPER</span>,
with a similar meaning; also <span class="sc lower">FANCY</span>, in the sense
of pets and favourites,—pugilists are often termed
<i>the</i> <span class="sc lower">FANCY</span>. The cant word <span class="sc lower">PRIG</span>, from the Saxon,
<i>priccan</i>, to filch, is also Shakesperian; so indeed
is <span class="sc lower">PIECE</span>, a contemptuous term for a young woman.
Shakespere was not the only vulgar dramatist of
his time. Ben Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher,
Brome, and other play-writers, occasionally put
cant words into the mouths of their low characters,
or employed old words which have since degenerated
into vulgarisms. <span class="sc">Crusty</span>, poor tempered;
“two of a <span class="sc lower">KIDNEY</span>,” two of a sort; <span class="sc lower">LARK</span>, a piece
of fun; <span class="sc lower">LUG</span>, to pull; <span class="sc lower">BUNG</span>, to give or pass;
<span class="sc lower">PICKLE</span>, a sad plight; <span class="sc lower">FRUMP</span>, to mock, are a few
specimens casually picked from the works of the
old histrionic writers.</p>

<p>One old English mode of canting, simple and
effective when familiarised by practice, was the
<a id="page-35" href="#page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
inserting a consonant betwixt each syllable; thus,
taking <i>g</i>, “How do you do?” would be “Hou<i>g</i>
do<i>g</i> you<i>g</i> do<i>g</i>?”<!--TN: added closing quotation mark--> The name very properly given to
this disagreeable nonsense, we are informed by
Grose, was <i>Gibberish</i>.</p>

<p>Another Cant has recently been attempted by
transposing the initial letters of words, so that a
mutton chop becomes a <i>c</i>utton <i>m</i>op, a pint of stout
a <i>s</i>tint of <i>p</i>out; but it is satisfactory to know that
it has gained no ground. This is called <i>Marrowskying</i>,
or <i>Medical Greek</i>, from its use by medical
students at the hospitals. Albert Smith terms it
the <i>Gower-street Dialect</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Language of Ziph</i>, I may add, is another
rude mode of disguising English, in use among
the students at Winchester College.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-2">ACCOUNT OF THE HIEROGLYPHICS USED BY VAGABONDS.</h2>

<p>One of the most singular chapters in a <i>History of
Vagabondism</i> would certainly be an account of the
Hieroglyphic signs used by tramps and thieves.
The reader may be startled to know that, in addition
to a secret language, the wandering tribes of
this country have private marks and symbolic signs
with which to score their successes, failures, and
advice to succeeding beggars; in fact, that the
country is really dotted over with beggars’ finger
posts and guide stones. The assertion, however
strange it may appear, is no fiction. The subject
was not long since brought under the attention of
the Government by Mr. Rawlinson.<a class="marker" id="marker-26" href="#footnote-26"><sup>26</sup></a> “There is,”
he says in his report, “a sort of blackguards’ literature,
and the initiated understand each other by
<a id="page-37" href="#page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>
slang [cant] terms, by pantomimic signs, <i>and by</i>
<span class="sc lower">HIEROGLYPHICS</span>. <i>The vagrant’s mark may be seen
in Havant, on corners of streets, on door posts, and
on house steps. Simple as these chalk lines appear,
they inform the succeeding vagrants of all they
require to know; and a few white scratches may
say, ‘be importunate,’ or ‘pass on.’</i>”</p>

<p>Another very curious account was taken from a
provincial newspaper, published in 1849, and forwarded
to <i>Notes and Queries</i>,<a class="marker" id="marker-27" href="#footnote-27"><sup>27</sup></a> under the head of
<span class="sc">Mendicant Freemasonry</span>. “Persons,” remarks
the writer, “indiscreet enough to open their
purses to the relief of the beggar tribe, would do
well to take a readily learned lesson as to the folly
of that misguided benevolence which encourages
and perpetuates vagabondism. Every door or
passage is pregnant with instruction as to the error
committed by the patron of beggars, as the beggar-marks
show that a system of freemasonry is followed,
by which a beggar knows whether it will
be worth his while to call into a passage or knock
at a door. Let any one examine the entrances to
the passages in any town, and there he will find
chalk marks, unintelligible to him, but significant
enough to beggars. If a thousand towns are
examined, the same marks will be found at every
passage entrance. The passage mark is a cypher
with a twisted tail: in some cases the tail projects
<a id="page-38" href="#page-38" class="pagenum" title="38"></a>
into the passage, in others outwardly; thus seeming
to indicate whether the houses down the passage
are worth calling at or not. Almost every door
has its marks: these are varied. In some cases
there is a cross on the brick work, in others a
cypher: the figures 1, 2, 3, are also used. Every
person may for himself test the accuracy of these
statements by the examination of the brick work
near his own doorway—thus demonstrating that
mendicity is a regular trade, carried out upon a
system calculated to save time, and realise the
largest profits.” These remarks refer mainly to
provincial towns, London being looked upon as the
tramps’ home, and therefore too <span class="sc lower">FLY</span>, or experienced,
to be duped by such means.</p>

<p>The only other notice of the hieroglyphics of
vagabonds that I have met with, is in <i>Mayhew’s
London Labour and London Poor</i>.<a class="marker" id="marker-28" href="#footnote-28"><sup>28</sup></a> Mayhew
obtained his information from two tramps, who
stated that hawkers employ these signs as well as
beggars. One tramp thus described the method of
<span class="sc lower">WORKING</span><a class="marker" id="marker-29-a" href="#footnote-29"><sup>29</sup></a> a small town. “Two hawkers (<span class="sc lower">PALS</span><a class="marker" id="marker-29" href="#footnote-29"><sup>29</sup></a>)
go together, but separate when they enter a village,
one taking one side of the road, and selling different
things; and so as to inform each other as to
the character of the people at whose houses they
call, <i>they chalk certain marks on their door posts</i>.”
Another informant stated that “if a <span class="sc lower">PATTERER</span><a class="marker" id="marker-29-b" href="#footnote-29"><sup>29</sup></a>
<a id="page-39" href="#page-39" class="pagenum" title="39"></a>
has been <span class="sc lower">CRABBED</span> (that is, offended) at any of the
<span class="sc lower">CRIBS</span> (houses), <i>he mostly chalks a signal at or
near the door</i>.”</p>

<p>Another use is also made of these hieroglyphics.
Charts of successful begging neighbourhoods are
rudely drawn, and symbolical signs attached to each
house to show whether benevolent or adverse.<a class="marker" id="marker-30" href="#footnote-30"><sup>30</sup></a> “In
many cases there is over the kitchen mantel-piece”
of a tramps’ lodging-house “<i>a map of the district</i>,
dotted here and there with memorandums of failure
or success.”<a class="marker" id="marker-31" href="#footnote-31"><sup>31</sup></a> A correct facsimile of one of these
singular maps has been placed as a <a href="#frontispiece">frontispiece</a>. It
<a id="page-40" href="#page-40" class="pagenum" title="40"></a>
was obtained from the patterers and tramps who
supplied a great many words for this work, and
who have been employed by me for some time in
collecting Old Ballads, Christmas Carols, Dying
Speeches, and Last Lamentations, as materials for
a <i>History of Popular Literature</i>. The reader will
no doubt be amused with the drawing. The
locality depicted is near Maidstone, in Kent, and I
am informed that it was probably sketched by a wandering
<span class="sc lower">SCREEVER</span><a class="marker" id="marker-32-a" href="#footnote-32"><sup>32</sup></a> in payment for a night’s lodging.
The English practice of marking everything,
and scratching names on public property, extends
itself to the tribe of vagabonds. On the map, as
may be seen in the left hand corner, some <span class="sc lower">TRAVELLER</span><a class="marker" id="marker-32-b" href="#footnote-32"><sup>32</sup></a>
has drawn a favourite or noted female, singularly
nick-named <i>Three-quarter Sarah</i>. What
were the peculiar accomplishments of this lady to
demand so uncommon a name, the reader will be
at a loss to discover, but a patterer says it probably
refers to a shuffling dance of that name, common in
tramps’ lodging-houses, and in which “¾ Sarah”
may have been a proficient. Above her, three
beggars or hawkers have reckoned their day’s
earnings, amounting to 13s.; and on the right a
tolerably correct sketch of a low hawker, or costermonger,
is drawn. “To Dover, the <i>nigh</i> way,” is
the exact phraseology; and “hup here,” a fair
specimen of the self-acquired education of the tribe
<a id="page-41" href="#page-41" class="pagenum" title="41"></a>
of cadgers. No key or explanation to the hieroglyphics
was given in the original, because it would
have been superfluous, when every inmate of the
lodging-house knew the marks from their cradle—or
rather their mother’s back.</p>

<p>Should there be no map, “in most lodging-houses
there is an old man who is guide to every
‘<span class="sc lower">WALK</span>’ in the vicinity, and who can tell each
house on every round, that is ‘good for a cold
tatur.’”<a class="marker" id="marker-33" href="#footnote-33"><sup>33</sup></a> The hieroglyphics that are used are:—</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="symbol"><img src="images/a_no_good.gif" alt="☓ [Cross]" /></span> NO GOOD; too poor, and know too much.</li>
  <li><span class="symbol"><img src="images/b_stop.gif" alt="◠+ [Semicircle plus cross]" /></span> STOP,—if you have what they want, they will buy. They are pretty “<i>fly</i>” (knowing).</li>
  <li><span class="symbol"><img src="images/c_go_in_this_direction.gif" alt="⸧— [Forked branch]" /></span> GO IN THIS DIRECTION, it is better than the other road. Nothing that way.</li>
  <li><span class="symbol"><img src="images/d_bone.gif" alt="◇ [Diamond]" /></span> <i>BONE</i> (good). Safe for a “cold tatur,” if for nothing else. “<i>Cheese your patter</i>” (don’t talk much) here.</li>
  <li><span class="symbol"><img src="images/e_cooper.gif" alt="▽ [Downward pointing triangle]" /></span> <i>COOPER’D</i> (spoilt), by too many tramps calling there.</li>
  <li><span class="symbol"><img src="images/f_gammy.gif" alt="□ [Square]" /></span> <i>GAMMY</i> (unfavourable), likely to have you taken up. Mind the dog.</li>
  <li><span class="symbol"><img src="images/g_flummoxed.gif" alt="☉ [Circle with dot]" /></span> <i>FLUMMUXED</i> (dangerous), sure of a month in “<i>quod</i>” (prison).</li>
  <li><span class="symbol"><img src="images/h_religious.gif" alt="⊕ [Circle with cross]" /></span> <i>RELIGIOUS</i>, but tidy on the whole.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where did these signs come from, and when
were they first used? are questions which I have
asked myself again and again, whilst endeavouring
to discover their history. Knowing the character
of the Gipseys, and ascertaining from a tramp that
they are well acquainted with the hieroglyphics,
<a id="page-42" href="#page-42" class="pagenum" title="42"></a>
“and have been as long ago as ever he could
remember,” I have little hesitation in ascribing the
invention to them. And strange it would be if
some modern Belzoni, or Champollion, discovered
in these beggars’ marks fragments of ancient
Egyptian or Hindoo hieroglyphical writing! But
this, of course, is a simple vagary of the imagination.</p>

<p>That the Gipseys were in the habit of leaving
memorials of the road they had taken, and the
successes that had befallen them, there can be no
doubt. In an old book, <i>The Triumph of Wit</i>,
1724, there is a passage which appears to have been
copied from some older work, and it runs thus:—“The
Gipseys set out twice a year, and scatter all
over England, each parcel having their appointed
stages, that they may not interfere, nor hinder each
other; and for that purpose, when they set forward
in the country, <i>they stick up boughs in the way of
divers kinds, according as it is agreed among them,
that one company may know which way another is
gone, and so take a different road</i>.” The works of
<i>Hoyland</i> and <i>Borrow</i> supply other instances.</p>

<p>I cannot close this subject without drawing
attention to the extraordinary fact, that actually on
the threshold of the gibbet the sign of the vagabond
is to be met with! “The murderer’s signal
is even exhibited from the gallows; as a red handkerchief
held in the hand of the felon about to be
<a id="page-43" href="#page-43" class="pagenum" title="43"></a>
executed is a token that he dies without having
betrayed any professional secrets.”<a class="marker" id="marker-34" href="#footnote-34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p>Since the first edition of this work was published
the author has received from various parts of England
numerous evidences of the still active use of
beggars’ marks, and mendicant hieroglyphics. One
gentleman writes from Great Yarmouth to say that
only a short time since, whilst residing in Norwich,
he used frequently to see them on the houses and
street corners. From another gentleman, a clergyman,
I learn that he has so far made himself
acquainted with the meanings of the signs employed,
that by himself marking the characters
<span class="symbol"><img src="images/f_gammy.gif" alt="□ [Square]" /></span> (<i>Gammy</i>) or <span class="symbol"><img src="images/g_flummoxed.gif" alt="☉ [Circle with dot]" /></span> (<i>Flummuxed</i>) on the gate posts
of his parsonage, he enjoys a singular immunity
from alms-seekers of all orders.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-3">THE HISTORY OF SLANG,<br />

<span class="subtitle">OR THE  VULGAR LANGUAGE OF FAST LIFE.</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Slang</span> is the language of street humour, of fast,
high, and low life. <span class="sc">Cant</span>, as was stated in the
chapter upon that subject, is the vulgar language
of secrecy. They are both universal and ancient,
and appear to have been the peculiar concomitants
of gay, vulgar, or worthless persons in every part
of the world, at every period of time. Indeed, if
we are to believe implicitly the saying of <i>the</i> wise
man, that “there is nothing new under the sun,”
the “fast” men of buried Nineveh, with their
knotty and door-matty looking beards, may have
cracked Slang jokes on the steps of Sennacherib’s
palace; and the stocks and stones of Ancient
Egypt, and the bricks of venerable and used-up
Babylon, may, for aught we know, be covered
with Slang hieroglyphics unknown to modern antiquarians,
and which have long been stumbling-blocks
to the philologist; so impossible is it at this
<a id="page-45" href="#page-45" class="pagenum" title="45"></a>
day to say what was then authorised, or what then
vulgar language. Slang is as old as speech and
the congregating together of people in cities. It
is the result of crowding, and excitement, and artificial
life. Even to the classics it was not unknown,
as witness the pages of Aristophanes and Plautus,
Terence and Athenæus. Martial, the epigrammatist,
is full of Slang. When an uninvited guest
accompanied his friend, the Slang of the day styled
him his <span class="sc lower">UMBRA</span>; when a man was trussed, neck
and heels, it called him jocosely <span class="sc lower">QUADRUPUS</span>.</p>

<p>Old English Slang was coarser, and depended
more upon downright vulgarity than our modern
Slang. It was a jesting speech, or humorous indulgence
for the thoughtless moment, or the drunken
hour, and it acted as a vent-peg for a fit of temper
or irritability; but it did not interlard and permeate
every description of conversation as now.
It was confined to nick-names and improper subjects,
and encroached but to a very small extent
upon the domain of authorised speech. Indeed, it
was exceedingly limited when compared with the
vast territory of Slang in such general favour and
complete circulation at the present day. Still,
although not an alarming encumbrance, as in our
time, Slang certainly did exist in this country centuries
ago, as we may see if we look down the page
of any respectable History of England. Cromwell
was familiarly called <span class="sc lower">OLD NOLL</span>,—just the same
<a id="page-46" href="#page-46" class="pagenum" title="46"></a>
as Buonaparte was termed <span class="sc lower">BONEY</span>, and Wellington
<span class="sc lower">CONKEY</span>, or <span class="sc lower">NOSEY</span>, only a few years ago. His
Legislature, too, was spoken of in a high-flavoured
way as the <span class="sc lower">BAREBONES</span>, or <span class="sc lower">RUMP</span> Parliament, and
his followers were nicknamed <span class="sc lower">ROUNDHEADS</span>, and
the peculiar religious sects of his protectorate were
styled <span class="sc lower">PURITANS</span> and <span class="sc lower">QUAKERS</span>.<a class="marker" id="marker-35" href="#footnote-35"><sup>35</sup></a> The Civil War
pamphlets, and the satirical hits of the Cavaliers and
the Commonwealth men, originated numerous Slang
words and vulgar similes, in full use at the present
moment. Here is a field of inquiry for the Philological
Society, indeed I may say a territory, for
there are thirty thousand of these partisan tracts.
Later still, in the court of Charles the Second, the
naughty ladies and the gay lords, with Rochester
at their head, talked Slang; and very naughty Slang
it was too! Fops, in those days, when “over head
and ears” in debt, and in continual fear of arrest,
termed their enemies, the bailiffs, <span class="sc lower">PHILISTINES</span><a class="marker" id="marker-36" href="#footnote-36"><sup>36</sup></a> or
<span class="sc lower">MOABITES</span>. At a later period, when collars were
worn detached from shirts, in order to save the
expense of washing—an object it would seem with
needy “swells” in all ages—they obtained the name
of <span class="sc lower">JACOBITES</span>. One half of the coarse wit in
<a id="page-47" href="#page-47" class="pagenum" title="47"></a>
Butler’s Hudibras lurks in the vulgar words and
phrases which he was so fond of employing. They
were more homely and forcible than the mild and
elegant sentences of Cowley, and the people,
therefore, hurrah’d them, and pronounced Butler
one of themselves,—or, as we should say, in a
joyful moment, a jolly good fellow. Orator Henley
preached and prayed in Slang, and first charmed
and then swayed the dirty mobs in Lincoln’s Inn
Fields by vulgarisms. Burly Grose mentions Henley,
with the remark that we owe a great many
Slang phrases to him. Swift, and old Sir Roger
L’Estrange, and Arbuthnot, were all fond of vulgar
or Slang language; indeed, we may see from a Slang
word used by the latter how curious is the gradual
adoption of vulgar terms in our standard dictionaries.
The worthy doctor, in order to annihilate
(or, as we should say with a fitting respect to the
subject under consideration, <span class="sc lower">SMASH</span>) an opponent,
thought proper on an occasion to use the word
<span class="sc lower">CABBAGE</span>, not in the ancient and esculentary sense
of a flatulent vegetable of the kitchen garden, but
in the at once Slang sense of purloining or cribbing.
Johnson soon met with the word, looked at it,
examined it, weighed it, and shook his head, but
out of respect to a brother doctor inserted it in
his dictionary, labelling it, however, prominently
“<i>Cant</i>;” whilst Walker and Webster, years after,
when <i>to cabbage</i> was to <i>pilfer</i> all over England,
<a id="page-48" href="#page-48" class="pagenum" title="48"></a>
placed the term in their dictionaries as an ancient
and very respectable word. Another Slang term,
<span class="sc lower">GULL</span>, to cheat, or delude, sometimes varied to
<span class="sc lower">GULLY</span>, is stated to be connected with the Dean of
St. Patrick. <span class="sc">Gull</span>, a dupe, or a fool, is often used
by our old dramatists, and is generally believed to
have given rise to the verb; but a curious little
edition of <i>Bamfylde Moore Carew</i>, published in
1827, says that <span class="sc lower">TO GULL</span>, or <span class="sc lower">GULLY</span>, is derived
from the well known <i>Gulliver</i>, the hero of the
famous <i>Travels</i>. How crammed with Slang are the
dramatic works of the last century! The writers
of the comedies and farces in those days must have
lived in the streets, and written their plays in the
public-houses, so filled are they with vulgarisms and
unauthorised words. The popular phrases, “I owe
you one,” “that’s one for his nob,” and “keep
moving, dad,” arose in this way.<a class="marker" id="marker-37" href="#footnote-37"><sup>37</sup></a> The second of
these sayings was, doubtless, taken from the card
table, for at cribbage the player who holds the
knave of the suit turned up counts “one for his
nob,” and the dealer who turns up a knave counts
“two for his heels.”</p>

<p>In Mrs. Centlivre’s admirable comedy of <i>A
Bold Stroke for a Wife</i>, we see the origin of that
popular street phrase, <span class="sc lower">THE REAL SIMON PURE</span>.
Simon Pure is the Quaker name adopted by
Colonel Feignwell as a trick to obtain the hand of
<a id="page-49" href="#page-49" class="pagenum" title="49"></a>
Mistress Anne Lovely in marriage. The veritable
Quaker, the “real Simon Pure,” recommended by
Aminadab Holdfast, of Bristol, as a fit sojourner
with Obadiah Prim, arrives at last to the discomfiture
of the Colonel, who, to maintain his position
and gain time, concocts a letter in which the real
Quaker is spoken of as a housebreaker who had
travelled in the “leather conveniency” from
Bristol, and adopted the garb and name of the
Western Quaker in order to pass off as the “<span class="sc lower">REAL
SIMON PURE</span>,” but only for the purpose of robbing
the house and cutting the throat of the perplexed
Obadiah. The scene in which the two
Simon Pures, the <i>real</i> and the <i>counterfeit</i>, meet,
is one of the best in the comedy.</p>

<p>Tom Brown, of “facetious memory,” as his
friends were wont to say, and Ned Ward, who
wrote humorous books, and when tired drew beer
for his customers at his ale-house in Long Acre,<a class="marker" id="marker-38" href="#footnote-38"><sup>38</sup></a>
were both great producers of Slang in the last century,
and to them we owe many popular current
phrases and household words.</p>

<p>Written Slang was checked rather than advanced
by the pens of Addison, Johnson, and Goldsmith,
although John Bee, the bottle-holder and historiographer
of the pugilistic band of brothers in the
youthful days of flat-nosed Tom Crib, has gravely
<a id="page-50" href="#page-50" class="pagenum" title="50"></a>
stated that Johnson, when young and rakish, contributed
to an early volume of the <i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i> a few pages, by way of specimen, of a
Slang dictionary, the result, Mr. Bee says, “of his
midnight ramblings!”<a class="marker" id="marker-39" href="#footnote-39"><sup>39</sup></a> And Goldsmith, I must
not forget to remark, certainly coined a few words,
although, as a rule, his pen was pure and graceful,
and adverse to neologisms. The word <span class="sc lower">FUDGE</span>, it has
been stated, was first used by him in literary composition,
although it originated with one Captain
Fudge, a notorious fibber, nearly a century before.
Street-phrases, nick-names, and vulgar words were
continually being added to the great stock of popular
Slang up to the commencement of the present
century, when it received numerous additions from
pugilism, horse-racing, and “fast” life generally,
which suddenly came into great public favour, and
was at its height when the Prince Regent was in
his rakish minority. Slang in those days was generally
termed <span class="sc lower">FLASH</span> language. So popular was it
with the “bloods” of high life that it constituted the
best paying literary capital for certain authors and
dramatists. Pierce Egan issued <i>Boxiana</i>, and <i>Life
in London</i>, six portly octavo volumes, crammed
with Slang; and Moncrieff wrote the most popular
farce of the day, <i>Tom and Jerry</i> (adapted from the
latter work), which, to use newspaper Slang, “took
<a id="page-51" href="#page-51" class="pagenum" title="51"></a>
the town by storm,” and, with its then fashionable
vulgarisms, made the fortune of the old Adelphi
Theatre, and was, without exception, the most
wonderful instance of a continuous theatrical <span class="sc lower">RUN</span>
in ancient or modern times. This, also, was brimful
of Slang. Other authors helped to popularise
and extend Slang down to our own time, when it
has taken a somewhat different turn, dropping
many of the Cant and old vulgar words, and
assuming a certain quaint and fashionable phraseology—Frenchy,
familiar, utilitarian, and jovial.
There can be no doubt but that common speech is
greatly influenced by fashion, fresh manners, and
that general change of ideas which steals over a
people once in a generation. But before I proceed
further into the region of <i>Slang</i>, it will be well to
say something on the etymology of the word.</p>

<p>The word <span class="sc">Slang</span> is only mentioned by two
lexicographers—Webster and Ogilvie. Johnson,
Walker, and the older compilers of dictionaries,
give <i>slang</i> the preterite of <i>sling</i>, but not a word
about <span class="sc">Slang</span> in the sense of low, vulgar, or unrecognised
language. The origin of the word has
often been asked for in literary journals and books,
but only one man, as far as I can learn, has ever
hazarded an etymology—Jonathan Bee, the vulgar
chronicler of the prize-ring.<a class="marker" id="marker-40" href="#footnote-40"><sup>40</sup></a> With a recklessness
peculiar to pugilism, Bee stated that <span class="sc">Slang</span> was
<a id="page-52" href="#page-52" class="pagenum" title="52"></a>
derived from “the <i>slangs</i> or fetters worn by prisoners,
having acquired that name from the manner
in which they were worn, as they required a sling
of string to keep them off the ground.” Bee had
just been nettled at Pierce Egan producing a new
edition of <i>Grose’s Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</i>,
and was determined to excel him in a vulgar dictionary
of his own, which should be more racy,
more pugilistic, and more original. How far he
succeeded in this latter particular his ridiculous
etymology of Slang will show. <span class="sc">Slang</span> is not an
English word, it is the Gipsey term for their secret
language, and its synonyme is <span class="sc lower">GIBBERISH</span>—another
word which was believed to have had no distinct
origin.<a class="marker" id="marker-41" href="#footnote-41"><sup>41</sup></a> Grose—stout and burly Captain Grose—who
we may characterise as the greatest antiquary,
joker, and drinker of porter of his day,
was the first author who put the word <span class="sc">Slang</span> into
print. It occurs in his <i>Classical Dictionary of the
Vulgar Tongue</i>, of 1785, with the signification that
it implies “Cant or vulgar language.” Grose, I
<a id="page-53" href="#page-53" class="pagenum" title="53"></a>
may remark in passing, was a great favourite with
the poet Burns, and so pleased by his extensive
powers of story-telling and grog-imbibing, that the
companionable and humour-loving Scotch bard
wrote for his fat friend—or, to use his own words,
“the fine, fat, fodgel wight”—the immortal poem
of “Tam O’Shanter.”</p>

<p>Without troubling the reader with a long account
of the transformation into an English term of the
word <span class="sc">Slang</span>, I may remark in passing that it is
easily seen how we obtained it from the Gipseys.
Hucksters and beggars on tramp, or at fairs and
races, associate and frequently join in any rough
enterprise with the Gipseys. The word would be
continually heard by them, and would in this
manner soon become <span class="sc">Cant</span>;<a class="marker" id="marker-42" href="#footnote-42"><sup>42</sup></a> and, when carried by
“fast” or vulgar fashionables from the society of
thieves and low characters to their own drawing-rooms,
would as quickly become <span class="sc">Slang</span>, and the representative
term for all vulgar or Slang language.</p>

<p>Any sudden excitement, peculiar circumstance,
or popular literary production, is quite sufficient to
originate and set going a score of Slang words.
Nearly every election or public agitation throws out
offshoots of the excitement, or scintillations of the
<a id="page-54" href="#page-54" class="pagenum" title="54"></a>
humour in the shape of Slang terms—vulgar at
first, but at length adopted as semi-respectable
from the force of habit and custom. There is
scarcely a condition or calling in life that does not
possess its own peculiar Slang. The professions,
legal and medical, have each familiar and unauthorised
terms for peculiar circumstances and things,
and I am quite certain that the clerical calling, or
“<i>the cloth</i>,” is not entirely free from this peculiarity.
Every workshop, warehouse, factory, and mill
throughout the country has its Slang, and so have
the public schools of Eton, Harrow, and Westminster,
and the great Universities of Oxford and
Cambridge. Sea Slang constitutes the principal
charm of a sailor’s “yarn,” and our soldiers and
officers have each their peculiar nicknames and
terms for things and subjects proper and improper.
A writer in <i>Household Words</i> (No. 183) has gone
so far as to remark, that a person “shall not read
one single parliamentary debate, as reported in a
first-class newspaper, without meeting scores of
Slang words;” and “that from Mr. Speaker in his
chair, to the Cabinet Ministers whispering behind
it—from mover to seconder, from true blue Protectionist
to extremest Radical—Mr. Barry’s New
House echoes and re-echoes with Slang.” Really it
seems as if our boasted English tongue was a very
paltry and ill-provided contrivance after all; or can
it be that we are the most vulgar of people?</p>
<a id="page-55" href="#page-55" class="pagenum" title="55"></a>

<p>The universality of Slang is extraordinary. Let
any person for a short time narrowly examine the
conversation of their dearest and nearest friends,
aye, censor-like, even slice and analyse their own
supposed correct talk, and they shall be amazed at
the numerous unauthorised, and what we can only
call vulgar, words they continually employ. It
is not the number of new words that we are ever
introducing that is so reprehensible, there is not so
much harm in this practice (frequently termed in
books “the license of expression”) if neologisms
are really required, but it is the continually encumbering
of <i>old</i> words with fresh and strange meanings.
Look at those simple and useful verbs,
<i>do</i>, <i>cut</i>, <i>go</i>, and <i>take</i>, and see how they are
hampered and overloaded, and then let us ask
ourselves how it is that a French or German
gentleman, be he ever so well educated, is continually
blundering and floundering amongst our
<i>little</i> words when trying to make himself understood
in an ordinary conversation. He may have
studied our language the required time, and have
gone through the usual amount of “grinding,” and
practised the common allotment of patience, but all
to no purpose as far as accuracy is concerned. I
am aware that most new words are generally regarded
as Slang, although afterwards they may
become useful and respectable additions to our
standard dictionaries. <span class="sc">Jabber</span> and <span class="sc lower">HOAX</span> were
<a id="page-56" href="#page-56" class="pagenum" title="56"></a>
Slang and Cant terms in Swift’s time; so indeed
were <span class="sc lower">MOB</span> and <span class="sc lower">SHAM</span>.<a class="marker" id="marker-43" href="#footnote-43"><sup>43</sup></a> Words directly from the
Latin and Greek, and Carlyleisms, are allowed
by an indulgent public to pass and take their
places in books. Sound contributes many Slang
words—a source that etymologists too frequently
overlook. Nothing pleases an ignorant person
more than a high-sounding term “full of fury.”
How melodious and drum-like are those vulgar
coruscations <span class="sc lower">RUMBUMPTIOUS</span>, <span class="sc lower">SLANTINGDICULAR</span>,
<span class="sc lower">SPLENDIFEROUS</span>, <span class="sc lower">RUMBUSTIOUS</span>, and <span class="sc lower">FERRICADOUZER</span>.
What a “pull” the sharp-nosed
lodging-house keeper thinks she has over her
victims if she can but hurl such testimonies of
a liberal education at them when they are disputing
her charges, and threatening to <span class="sc lower">ABSQUATULATE</span>!
In the United States the vulgar-genteel
even excel the poor “stuck-up” Cockneys in their
formation of a native fashionable language. How
charming to a refined ear are <span class="sc lower">ABSKIZE</span>, <span class="sc lower">CATAWAMPOUSLY</span>,
<span class="sc lower">EXFLUNCTIFY</span>, <span class="sc lower">OBSCUTE</span>, <span class="sc lower">KESLOSH</span>,
<span class="sc lower">KESOUSE</span>, <span class="sc lower">KESWOLLOP</span>, and <span class="sc lower">KEWHOLLUX</span>! Vulgar
words representing action and brisk movement
<a id="page-57" href="#page-57" class="pagenum" title="57"></a>
often owe their origin to sound. Mispronunciation,
too, is another great source of vulgar or slang
words—<span class="sc lower">RAMSHACKLE</span>, <span class="sc lower">SHACKLY</span>, <span class="sc lower">NARY-ONE</span> for
neither, or neither one, <span class="sc lower">OTTOMY</span> for anatomy,
<span class="sc lower">RENCH</span> for rinse, are specimens. The commonalty
dislike frequently occurring words difficult of pronunciation,
and so we have the street abridgments
of <span class="sc lower">BIMEBY</span> for by and by, <span class="sc lower">CAZE</span> for because, <span class="sc lower">GIN</span>
for given, <span class="sc lower">HANKERCHER</span> for handkerchief, <span class="sc lower">RUMATIZ</span>
for rheumatism, <span class="sc lower">BACKY</span> for tobacco, and many
others, not perhaps Slang, but certainly all vulgarisms.
Archbishop Whately, in his interesting
<i>Remains of Bishop Copleston</i>, has inserted a leaf
from the Bishop’s note-book on the popular corruption
of names, mentioning among others <span class="sc lower">KICKSHAWS</span>,
as from the French, <i>quelques choses</i>;
<span class="sc lower">BEEFEATER</span>, the lubberly guardian of royalty
in a procession, and the supposed devourer of
enormous beefsteaks, as but a vulgar pronunciation
of the French, <i>buffetier</i>; and <span class="sc lower">GEORGE</span> and <span class="sc lower">CANNON</span>,
the sign of a public-house, as nothing but a
corruption (although so soon!) of the popular
premier of the last generation, <i>George Canning</i>.
Literature has its Slang terms; and the desire on
the part of writers to say funny and startling things
in a novel and curious way (the late <i>Household
Words</i>,<a class="marker" id="marker-44" href="#footnote-44"><sup>44</sup></a> for instance), contributes many unauthorised
words to the great stock of Slang.</p>
<a id="page-58" href="#page-58" class="pagenum" title="58"></a>

<p><i>Fashionable</i>, or <i>Upper-class Slang</i>, is of several
varieties. There is the Belgravian, military and
naval, parliamentary, dandy, and the reunion and
visiting Slang. Concerning the Slang of the
fashionable world, a writer in <i>Household Words</i>
curiously, but not altogether truthfully, remarks,
that it is mostly imported from France; and that
an unmeaning gibberish of Gallicisms runs through
English fashionable conversation, and fashionable
novels, and accounts of fashionable parties in the
fashionable newspapers. Yet, ludicrously enough,
immediately the fashionable magnates of England
seize on any French idiom, the French themselves
not only universally abandon it to us, but positively
repudiate it altogether from their idiomatic
vocabulary. If you were to tell a well-bred Frenchman
that such and such an aristocratic marriage
was on the <i>tapis</i>, he would stare with astonishment,
and look down on the carpet in the startled endeavour
to find a marriage in so unusual a place. If
you were to talk to him of the <i>beau monde</i>, he
would imagine you meant the world which God
made, not half-a-dozen streets and squares between
Hyde Park Corner and Chelsea Bun House. The
<i>thé dansante</i><a class="marker" id="marker-45" href="#footnote-45"><sup>45</sup></a> would be completely inexplicable to
him. If you were to point out to him the Dowager
<a id="page-59" href="#page-59" class="pagenum" title="59"></a>
Lady Grimguffin acting as <i>chaperon</i> to Lady
Amanda Creamville, he would imagine you were
referring to the <i>petit Chaperon rouge</i>—to little
Red Riding Hood. He might just understand
what was meant by <i>vis-a-vis</i>, <i>entremets</i>, and some
others of the flying horde of frivolous little foreign
slangisms hovering about fashionable cookery and
fashionable furniture; but three-fourths of them
would seem to him as barbarous French provincialisms,
or, at best, but as antiquated and obsolete
expressions, picked out of the letters of Mademoiselle
Scuderi, or the tales of Crebillon the
“younger.” Servants, too, appropriate the scraps
of French conversation which fall from their
masters’ guests at the dinner table, and forthwith in
the world of flunkeydom the word “know” is
disused, and the lady’s maid, in doubt on a particular
point, asks John whether or no he <span class="sc lower">SAVEYS</span>
it?<a class="marker" id="marker-46" href="#footnote-46"><sup>46</sup></a> What, too, can be more abominable than
that heartless piece of fashionable newspaper Slang,
regularly employed when speaking of the successful
courtship of young people in the fashionable
world:—</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="hang"><span class="sc">Marriage in high life.</span>—We understand that a marriage
is <span class="sc lower">ARRANGED</span> (!) betwixt the Lady, &amp;c. &amp;c., and the
Honourable, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="continue"><span class="sc">Arranged!</span> Is that cold-blooded Smithfield or
Mark-lane term for a sale or a purchase the proper
<a id="page-60" href="#page-60" class="pagenum" title="60"></a>
word to express the hopeful, joyous, golden union
of young and trustful hearts? Which is the proper
way to pronounce the names of great people, and
what the correct authority? Lord Cowper, we are
often assured, is Lord <i>Cooper</i>—on this principle
Lord Cowley would certainly be Lord <i>Cooley</i>—and
Mr. Carew, we are told, should be Mr. <i>Carey</i>,
Ponsonby should be <i>Punsunby</i>, Eyre should he
<i>Aire</i>, Cholmondeley should be <i>Chumley</i>, St. John
<i>Singen</i>, Majoribanks <i>Marshbanks</i>, Derby <i>Darby</i> (its
ancient pronunciation), and Powell should always
be <i>Poel</i>. I don’t know that these lofty persons have
as much cause to complain of the illiberality of fate
in giving them disagreeable names as did the celebrated
Psyche (as she was termed by Tom Moore),
whose original name, through her husband, was
<i>Teague</i>, but which was afterwards altered to Tighe.</p>

<p><i>Parliamentary Slang</i>, excepting a few peculiar
terms connected with “<i>the</i> House” (scarcely Slang,
I suppose), is mainly composed of fashionable,
literary, and learned Slang. When members, however,
get excited and wish to be forcible, they are
often not very particular which of the street terms
they select, providing it carries, as good old Dr.
South said, plenty of wild-fire in it. Sir Hugh
Cairns very lately spoke of “that homely but
expressive phrase, <span class="sc lower">DODGE</span>.” Out of “the House,”
several Slang terms are used in connection with
Parliament or members of Parliament. If Lord
<a id="page-61" href="#page-61" class="pagenum" title="61"></a>
Palmerston is known by name to the tribes of the
Caucasus and Asia Minor as a great foreign
diplomatist, when the name of our Queen Victoria
is an unknown title to the inhabitants of those
parts—as was stated in the <i>Times</i> a short time
ago,—I have only to remark that amongst the
costers and the wild inhabitants of the streets he
is better known as <span class="sc lower">PAM</span>. I have often heard the
cabmen on the “ranks” in Piccadilly remark of
the late Chancellor of the Exchequer, when he
has been going from his residence at Grosvenor
Gate, to Derby House in St. James’s Square,—“hollo,
there! de yer see old <span class="sc lower">DIZZY</span> doing a
stump?” A <span class="sc lower">PLUMPER</span> is a single vote at an election,—not
a <span class="sc lower">SPLIT-TICKET</span>; and electors who have
occupied a house, no matter how small, and boiled a
pot in it, thus qualifying themselves for voting, are
termed <span class="sc lower">POT-WOLLOPERS</span>. A quiet <span class="sc lower">WALK OVER</span>
is a re-election without opposition and much cost.
A <span class="sc lower">CAUCUS</span> meeting refers to the private assembling
of politicians before an election, when candidates
are chosen and measures of action agreed upon.
The term comes from America. A <span class="sc lower">JOB</span>, in political
phraseology, is a government office or contract
obtained by secret influence or favouritism. Only
the other day the <i>Times</i> spoke of “the patriotic
member of Parliament <span class="sc lower">POTTED OUT</span> in a dusty
little lodging somewhere about Bury-street.” The
term <span class="sc lower">QUOCKERWODGER</span>, although referring to a
<a id="page-62" href="#page-62" class="pagenum" title="62"></a>
wooden toy figure which jerks its limbs about
when pulled by a string, has been supplemented
with a political meaning. A pseudo-politician,
one whose strings of action are pulled by somebody
else, is now often termed a <span class="sc lower">QUOCKERWODGER</span>. The
term <span class="sc lower">RAT</span>, too, in allusion to rats deserting vessels
about to sink, has long been employed towards
those turncoat politicians who change their party
for interest. Who that occasionally passes near the
Houses of Parliament has not often noticed stout
or careful M.P.s walk briskly through the Hall
and on the curb-stone in front, with umbrella or
walking cane uplifted, shout to the cabmen on the
rank, <span class="sc lower">FOUR-WHEELER</span>! The term is a useful one,
but I am afraid we must consider it Slang, until it
is stamped with the mint mark of lexicographical
authority.<a class="marker" id="marker-47" href="#footnote-47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p><i>Military</i>, or <i>Officers’ Slang</i> is on a par, and of a
character with <i>Dandy Slang</i>. Inconvenient friends,
or elderly and lecturing relatives, are pronounced
<span class="sc lower">DREADFUL BORES</span>. Four-wheel cabs are called
<span class="sc lower">BOUNDERS</span>; and a member of the Four-in-hand
<a id="page-63" href="#page-63" class="pagenum" title="63"></a>
Club, driving to Epsom on the Derby day, would,
using fashionable slang phraseology, speak of it as
<span class="sc lower">TOOLING HIS DRAG DOWN TO THE DERBY</span>. A
vehicle, if not a <span class="sc lower">DRAG</span> (or dwag) is a <span class="sc lower">TRAP</span>, or
a <span class="sc lower">CASK</span>; and if the <span class="sc lower">TURN OUT</span> happens to be in
other than a trim condition, it is pronounced at
once as not <span class="sc lower">DOWN THE ROAD</span>. Your city swell
would say it is not <span class="sc lower">UP TO THE MARK</span>; whilst
the costermonger would call it <span class="sc lower">WERY DICKEY</span>. In
the army a barrack or military station is known as
a <span class="sc lower">LOBSTER-BOX</span>; to “cram” for an examination
is to <span class="sc lower">MUG-UP</span>; to reject from the examination is to
<span class="sc lower">SPIN</span>; and that part of the barrack occupied by
subalterns is frequently spoken of as the <span class="sc lower">ROOKERY</span>.
In dandy or swell Slang, any celebrity, from Robson
of the Olympic, to the Pope of Rome, is a
<span class="sc lower">SWELL</span>. Wrinkled faced old professors, who hold
dress and fashionable tailors in abhorrence, are
called <span class="sc lower">AWFUL SWELLS</span>,—if they happen to be very
learned or clever. I may remark that in this upper
class Slang a title is termed a <span class="sc lower">HANDLE</span>; trousers,
<span class="sc lower">INEXPRESSIBLES</span>; or when of a large pattern, or
the inflated Zouave cut, <span class="sc lower">HOWLING BAGS</span>; a
superior appearance, <span class="sc lower">EXTENSIVE</span>; a four-wheeled
cab, a <span class="sc lower">BIRDCAGE</span>; a dance, a <span class="sc lower">HOP</span>; dining at
another man’s table, “sitting under his <span class="sc lower">MAHOGANY</span>;”
anything flashy or showy, <span class="sc lower">LOUD</span>; the
peculiar make or cut of a coat, its <span class="sc lower">BUILD</span>; full
dress, <span class="sc lower">FULL-FIG</span>; wearing clothes which represent
<a id="page-64" href="#page-64" class="pagenum" title="64"></a>
the very extreme of fashion, “dressing to <span class="sc lower">DEATH</span>;”
a reunion, a <span class="sc lower">SPREAD</span>; a friend (or a “good fellow”),
a <span class="sc lower">TRUMP</span>; a difficulty, a <span class="sc lower">SCREW LOOSE</span>; and everything
that is unpleasant, “from bad sherry to a
writ from a tailor,” <span class="sc lower">JEUCED INFERNAL</span>. The
military phrase, “to send a man to <span class="sc lower">COVENTRY</span>,”
or permit no person to speak to him, although an
ancient saying, must still be considered Slang.</p>

<p>The <i>Universities of Oxford and Cambridge</i>, and
the great public schools, are the hotbeds of fashionable
Slang. Growing boys and high-spirited young
fellows detest restraint of all kinds, and prefer
making a dash at life in a Slang phraseology of
their own, to all the set forms and syntactical rules
of <i>Alma Mater</i>. Many of the most expressive
words in a common chit-chat, or free-and-easy conversation,
are old University vulgarisms. <span class="sc">Cut</span>, in
the sense of dropping an acquaintance, was originally
a Cambridge form of speech; and <span class="sc lower">HOAX</span>, to
deceive or ridicule, we are informed by Grose, was
many years since an Oxford term. Among the
words that fast society has borrowed from our great
scholastic [I was going to say <i>establishments</i>, but I
remembered the linen drapers’ horrid and habitual
use of the word] institutions, I find <span class="sc lower">CRIB</span>, a house
or apartments; <span class="sc lower">DEAD-MEN</span>, empty wine bottles;
<span class="sc lower">DRAWING TEETH</span>,<a class="marker" id="marker-48" href="#footnote-48"><sup>48</sup></a> wrenching off knockers;
<a id="page-65" href="#page-65" class="pagenum" title="65"></a>
<span class="sc lower">FIZZING</span>, first-rate, or splendid; <span class="sc lower">GOVERNOR</span>, or
<span class="sc lower">RELIEVING OFFICER</span>, the general term for a male
parent; <span class="sc lower">PLUCKED</span>, defeated or turned back; <span class="sc lower">QUIZ</span>,
to scrutinise, or a prying old fellow; and <span class="sc lower">ROW</span>, a
noisy disturbance. The Slang words in use at Oxford
and Cambridge would alone fill a volume. As
examples I may instance <span class="sc lower">SCOUT</span>, which at Oxford
refers to an undergraduate’s valet, whilst the same
menial at Cambridge is termed a <span class="sc lower">GYP</span>,—popularly
derived by the Cantabs from the Greek, <span class="sc lower">GYPS</span>
(γυψ), a vulture; <span class="sc lower">SCULL</span>, the head, or master of a
college; <span class="sc lower">BATTLES</span>, the Oxford term for rations,
changed at Cambridge into <span class="sc lower">COMMONS</span>. The term
<span class="sc lower">DICKEY</span>, a half shirt, I am told, originated with the
students of Trinity College, Dublin, who at first
styled it a <span class="sc lower">TOMMY</span>, from the Greek, τομη, a section.
<span class="sc">Crib</span>, a literal translation, is now universal;
<span class="sc lower">GRIND</span> refers to a walk, or “constitutional;”
<span class="sc lower">HIVITE</span> is a student of St. Begh’s (St. Bee’s) College,
Cumberland; to <span class="sc lower">JAPAN</span>, in this Slang speech, is
to ordain; <span class="sc lower">MORTAR-BOARD</span> is a square college cap;
<span class="sc lower">SIM</span> a student of a Methodistical turn,—in allusion
to the Rev. Charles Simeon; <span class="sc lower">SLOGGERS</span>, at Cambridge,
refers to the second division of race boats,
known at Oxford as <span class="sc lower">TORPIDS</span>; <span class="sc lower">SPORT</span> is to show
or exhibit; <span class="sc lower">TROTTER</span> is the jocose term for a tailor’s
man who goes round for orders; and <span class="sc lower">TUFTS</span> are
wealthy students who dine with the <span class="sc lower">DONS</span>, and are
distinguished by golden <i>tufts</i>, or tassels, in their
<a id="page-66" href="#page-66" class="pagenum" title="66"></a>
caps. There are many terms in use at Oxford not
known at Cambridge; and such Slang names as
<span class="sc lower">COACH</span>, <span class="sc lower">GULF</span>, <span class="sc lower">HARRY-SOPH</span>, <span class="sc lower">POKER</span>, or <span class="sc lower">POST-MORTEM</span>,
common enough at Cambridge, are seldom
or never heard at the great sister University. For
numerous other examples of college Slang, the
reader is referred to the Dictionary.</p>

<p><i>Religious Slang</i>, strange as the compound may
appear, exists with other descriptions of vulgar
speech at the present day. <i>Punch</i>, a short time
since, in one of those half-humorous, half-serious
articles in which he is so fond of lecturing any
national abuse or popular folly, remarked that
Slang had “long since penetrated into the Forum,
and now we meet it in the Senate, <i>and even the
Pulpit itself is no longer free from its intrusion</i>.”
I would not, for one moment, wish to infer that the
practice is general. On the contrary, and in justice
to the clergy, it must be said that the principal
disseminators of pure English throughout the
country are the ministers of our Established
Church. Yet it cannot be denied but that a great
deal of Slang phraseology and disagreeable vulgarism
have gradually crept into the very pulpits
which should give forth as pure speech as doctrine.</p>

<p>Dean Conybeare, in his able <i>Essay on Church
Parties</i>,<a class="marker" id="marker-49" href="#footnote-49"><sup>49</sup></a> has noticed this wretched addition to our
pulpit speech. As stated in his Essay, the practice
<a id="page-67" href="#page-67" class="pagenum" title="67"></a>
appears to confine itself mainly to the exaggerated
forms of the High and Low Church—the Tractarians
and the “Recordites.”<a class="marker" id="marker-50" href="#footnote-50"><sup>50</sup></a> By way of illustration,
the Dean cites the evening parties, or social
meetings, common amongst the wealthier lay members
of the Recordite (exaggerated Evangelical)
Churches, where the principal topics discussed—one
or more favourite clergymen being present in a
quasi-official manner—are “the merits and demerits
of different preachers, the approaching restoration
of the Jews, the date of the Millennium, the progress
of the ‘Tractarian heresy,’ and the anticipated
‘perversion’ of High Church neighbours.” These
subjects are canvassed in a dialect differing considerably
from common English. The words <span class="sc lower">FAITHFUL</span>,
<span class="sc lower">TAINTED</span>, <span class="sc lower">ACCEPTABLE</span>, <span class="sc lower">DECIDED</span>, <span class="sc lower">LEGAL</span>, and
many others, are used in a technical sense. We hear
that Mr. A. has been more <span class="sc lower">OWNED</span> than Mr. B; and
that Mr. C. has more <span class="sc lower">SEALS</span><a class="marker" id="marker-51" href="#footnote-51"><sup>51</sup></a> than Mr. D. Again,
the word <span class="sc lower">GRACIOUS</span> is invested with a meaning as
extensive as that attached by young ladies to <i>nice</i>.
Thus, we hear of a “<span class="sc lower">GRACIOUS</span> sermon,” a
“<span class="sc lower">GRACIOUS</span> meeting,” a “<span class="sc lower">GRACIOUS</span> child,”<!--TN: added closing quotation mark--> and
even a “<span class="sc lower">GRACIOUS</span> whipping.” The word <span class="sc lower">DARK</span>
<a id="page-68" href="#page-68" class="pagenum" title="68"></a>
has also a new and peculiar usage. It is applied to
every person, book, or place, not impregnated with
Recordite principles. We once were witnesses of a
ludicrous misunderstanding resulting from this phraseology.
“What did you mean (said A. to B.) by
telling me that —— was such a very <span class="sc lower">DARK</span> village?
I rode over there to day, and found the street particularly
broad and cheerful, and there is not a tree
in the place.” “<i>The Gospel is not preached there</i>,”
was B.’s laconic reply. The conclusion of one of
these singular evening parties is generally marked
by an “<i>exposition</i>”—an unseasonable sermon of
nearly one hour’s duration, circumscribed by no text,
and delivered from the table by one of the clerical
visitors with a view to “improve the occasion.”
In the same Essay, the religious Slang terms for the
two great divisions of the Established Church, receive
some explanation. The old-fashioned High
Church party, rich and “stagnant,” noted for its
“sluggish mediocrity, hatred of zeal, dread of innovation,
abuse of dissent, blundering and languid
utterance,” is called the <span class="sc lower">HIGH AND DRY</span>; whilst
the corresponding division, known as the Low
Church, equally stagnant with the former, but poorer,
and more lazily inclined (from absence of education),
to dissent, receives the nickname of the <span class="sc lower">LOW AND
SLOW</span>. Already have these terms become so familiar
that they are shortened, in ordinary conversation, to
the <span class="sc lower">DRY</span> and the <span class="sc lower">SLOW</span>. The so-called “Broad
<a id="page-69" href="#page-69" class="pagenum" title="69"></a>
Church,” I should remark, is often spoken of as the
<span class="sc lower">BROAD AND SHALLOW</span>.</p>

<p>What can be more objectionable than the irreverent
and offensive manner in which many of the
dissenting ministers continually pronounce the
names of the Deity, God and Lord. God, instead
of pronouncing in the plain and beautifully simple
old English way, <span class="sc lower">G-O-D</span>, they drawl out into
<span class="sc lower">GORDE</span> or <span class="sc lower">GAUDE</span>; and Lord, instead of speaking
in the proper way, they desecrate into <span class="sc lower">LOARD</span> or
<span class="sc lower">LOERD</span>,—lingering on the <i>u</i>, or the <i>r</i>, as the case may
be, until an honest hearer feels disgusted, and almost
inclined to run the gauntlet of beadles and deacons,
and pull the vulgar preacher from his pulpit. I
have observed that many young preachers strive hard
to acquire this peculiar pronunciation, in imitation
of the older ministers. What can more properly,
then, be called Slang, or, indeed, the most objectionable
of Slang, than this studious endeavour to
pronounce the most sacred names in a uniformly
vulgar and unbecoming manner. If the old-fashioned
preacher whistled Cant through his nose,
the modern vulgar reverend whines Slang from the
more natural organ. These vagaries of speech
will, perhaps, by an apologist, he termed “pulpit
peculiarities,” and the writer dared to intermeddle
with a subject that is or should be removed from
his criticisms. The terms used by the mob towards
the Church, however illiberal and satirically vulgar,
<a id="page-70" href="#page-70" class="pagenum" title="70"></a>
are within his province in such an inquiry as the
present. A clergyman, in vulgar language, is
spoken of as a <span class="sc lower">CHOKER</span>, a <span class="sc lower">CUSHION THUMPER</span>, a
<span class="sc lower">DOMINE</span>, an <span class="sc lower">EARWIG</span>, a <span class="sc lower">GOSPEL GRINDER</span>, a <span class="sc lower">GRAY
COAT PARSON</span>—if he is a lessee of the great tithes,
<span class="sc lower">ONE IN TEN</span>, <span class="sc lower">PADRE</span>—if spoken of by an Anglo-Indian,
a <span class="sc lower">ROOK</span>, a <span class="sc lower">SPOUTER</span>, a <span class="sc lower">WHITE CHOKER</span>,
or a <span class="sc lower">WARMING PAN RECTOR</span>, if he only holds the
living <i>pro tempore</i>, or is simply keeping the place
warm for his successor. If a Tractarian, his outer
garment is rudely spoken of as a <span class="sc lower">PYGOSTOLE</span>, or
<span class="sc lower">M.B. (MARK OF THE BEAST) COAT</span>. His profession
is termed <span class="sc lower">THE CLOTH</span>, and his practice
<span class="sc lower">TUB THUMPING</span>. Should he belong to the dissenting
body, he is probably styled a <span class="sc lower">PANTILER</span>, or a
<span class="sc lower">PSALM SMITER</span>, or, perhaps, a <span class="sc lower">SWADDLER</span>. His
chapel, too, is spoken of as a <span class="sc lower">SCHISM SHOP</span>. A
Roman Catholic, I may remark, is coarsely named
a <span class="sc lower">BRISKET BEATER</span>.</p>

<p>Particular as lawyers generally are about the
meaning of words, they have not prevented an unauthorised
phraseology from arising, which we may
term <i>Legal Slang</i>. So forcibly did this truth impress
a late writer, that he wrote in a popular
journal, “You may hear Slang every day in term
from barristers in their robes, at every mess-table,
at every bar-mess, at every college commons, and in
every club dining-room.” Swift, in his <i>Art of
Polite Conversation</i> (p. 15), published a century and
<a id="page-71" href="#page-71" class="pagenum" title="71"></a>
a half ago, states that <span class="sc lower">VARDI</span> was the Slang in his
time for “verdict.” A few of the most common
and well-known terms used out of doors, with reference
to legal matters, are <span class="sc lower">COOK</span>, to hash or
make up a balance-sheet; <span class="sc lower">DIPPED</span>, mortgaged; <span class="sc lower">DUN</span>,
to solicit payment; <span class="sc lower">FULLIED</span>, to be “<i>fully</i> committed
for trial;” <span class="sc lower">LAND-SHARK</span>, a sailor’s definition
of a lawyer; <span class="sc lower">LIMB OF THE LAW</span>, a milder term for
the same “professional;” <span class="sc lower">MONKEY WITH A LONG
TAIL</span>, a mortgage—phrase used in the well-known
case for libel, Smith <i>v.</i> Jones; <span class="sc lower">MOUTHPIECE</span>, the
coster’s term for his counsel; “to go through the
<span class="sc lower">RING</span>,” to take advantage of the Insolvency Act;
<span class="sc lower">SMASH</span>, to become bankrupt; <span class="sc lower">SNIPE</span>, an attorney
with a long bill; and <span class="sc lower">WHITEWASHED</span>, said of any
debtor who has taken the benefit of the Insolvent
Act. Lawyers, from their connection with the
police courts, and transactions with persons in every
grade of society, have ample opportunities for acquiring
street Slang, which in cross-questioning and
wrangling they frequently avail themselves of.</p>

<p>It has been said there exists a <i>Literary Slang</i>,
or “the <i>Slang of Criticism</i>—dramatic, artistic, and
scientific. Such words as ‘æsthetic,’ ‘transcendental,’
the ‘harmonies,’ the ‘unities,’ a ‘myth:’
such phrases as ‘an exquisite <i>morceau</i> on the big
drum,’ a ‘scholarlike rendering of John the
Baptist’s great toe,’ ‘keeping harmony,’ ‘middle
distance,’ ‘ærial perspective,’ ‘delicate handling,’
<a id="page-72" href="#page-72" class="pagenum" title="72"></a>
‘nervous chiaroscuro,’ and the like.” More
than one literary journal that I could name
are fond of employing such terms in their art
criticisms, but it is questionable, after all, whether
they are not allowable as the generous inflections
and bendings of a bountiful language, for the
purpose of expressing fresh phases of thought, and
ideas not yet provided with representative words.<a class="marker" id="marker-52" href="#footnote-52"><sup>52</sup></a>
The well-known and ever-acceptable <i>Punch</i>, with
his fresh and choice little pictorial bits by Leech,
often employs a Slang term to give point to a joke,
or humour to a line of satire. A short time since
(4th May, 1859) he gave an original etymology of
the school-boy-ism <span class="sc lower">SLOG</span>. <span class="sc">Slog</span>, said the classical
and studious <i>Punch</i>, is derived from the Greek
word <span class="sc lower">SLOGO</span>, to baste, to wallop, to slaughter. And
it was not long ago that he amused his readers with
two columns on <i>Slang and Sanscrit</i>:—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The allegory which pervades the conversation of all Eastern
nations,” remarked the philosophical <i>Punch</i>, “is the foundation
of Western Slang; and the increased number of students of the
Oriental languages, especially since Sanscrit and Arabic have
been made subjects for the Indian Civil Service Examinations,
may have contributed to supply the English language with a
<a id="page-73" href="#page-73" class="pagenum" title="73"></a>
large portion of its new dialect. While, however, the spirit of
allegory comes from the East, there is so great a difference between
the brevity of Western expression and the more cumbrous
diction of the Oriental, that the origin of a phrase becomes
difficult to trace. Thus, for instance, whilst the Turkish merchant
might address his friend somewhat as follows—‘That
which seems good to my father is to his servant as the perfumed
breath of the west wind in the calm night of the Arabian
summer;’ the Western negociator observes more briefly, ‘<span class="sc lower">ALL
SERENE</span>!’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="continue">But the vulgar term, <span class="sc lower">BRICK</span>, <i>Punch</i> remarks in
illustration,</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="continue">“must be allowed to be an exception, its Greek derivation
being universally admitted, corresponding so exactly as it does in
its rectangular form and compactness to the perfection of manhood,
according to the views of <i>Plato</i> and <i>Simonides</i>; but any
deviation from the simple expression, in which locality is indicated,—as,
for instance, ‘a genuine Bath,’—decidedly breathes
the Oriental spirit.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="continue">It is singular that what <i>Punch</i> says, unwittingly
and in humour, respecting the Slang expression,
<span class="sc lower">BOSH</span>, should be quite true. <span class="sc">Bosh</span>, remarks <i>Punch</i>,
after speaking of it as belonging to the stock of
words pilfered from the Turks, “is one whose innate
force and beauty the slangographer is reluctantly
compelled to admit. It is the only word
which seems a proper appellation for a great deal
which we are obliged to hear and to read every
day of our life.” <span class="sc">Bosh</span>, nonsense or stupidity, is
derived from the <i>Gipsey</i> and the <i>Persian</i>. The
universality of Slang, I may here remark, is proved
<a id="page-74" href="#page-74" class="pagenum" title="74"></a>
by its continual use in the pages of <i>Punch</i>. Whoever
thinks, unless belonging to a past generation,
of asking a friend to explain the stray vulgar words
employed by the <i>London Charivari</i>?</p>

<p>The <i>Athenæum</i>, the most learned and censor-like
of all the “weeklies,” often indulges in a Slang
word, when force of expression or a little humour
is desired, or when the writer wishes to say something
which is better said in Slang, or so-called
vulgar speech, than in the authorised language of
Dr. Johnson or Lindley Murray. It was but the
other day that a writer in its pages employed an old
and favourite word, used always when we were
highly pleased with any article at school,—<span class="sc lower">STUNNING</span>.
<i>Bartlett</i>, the compiler of the <i>Dictionary of
Americanisms</i>, continually cites the <i>Athenæum</i> as
using Slang and vulgar expressions;—but the
magazine the American refers to is not the excellent
literary journal which is so esteemed at the
present day, it was a smaller, and now defunct
“weekly.” Many other highly respectable journals
often use Slang words and phrases. The <i>Times</i> (or,
in Slang, the <span class="sc lower">THUNDERER</span>) frequently employs unauthorised
terms; and, following a “leader”<a class="marker" id="marker-53-a" href="#footnote-53"><sup>53</sup></a> of the
purest and most eloquent English composition, may
sometimes be seen another “article”<a class="marker" id="marker-53-b" href="#footnote-53"><sup>53</sup></a> on a totally
<a id="page-75" href="#page-75" class="pagenum" title="75"></a>
different subject, containing, perhaps, a score or
more of exceedingly questionable words. Among
the words and phrases which may be included under
the head of Literary Slang are,—<span class="sc lower">BALAAM</span>, matter
kept constantly in type about monstrous productions
of nature, to fill up spaces in newspapers;
<span class="sc lower">BALAAM BOX</span>, the term given in <i>Blackwood</i> to the
depository for rejected articles; and <span class="sc lower">SLATE</span>, to pelt
with abuse, or <span class="sc lower">CUT UP</span> in a review. The Slang
names given to newspapers are curious;—thus, the
<i>Morning Advertiser</i> is known as the <span class="sc lower">TAP-TUB</span>, the
<span class="sc lower">TIZER</span>, and the <span class="sc lower">GIN AND GOSPEL GAZETTE</span>. The
<i>Morning Post</i> has obtained the suggestive <i>soubriquet</i>
of <span class="sc lower">JEAMES</span>; whilst the <i>Morning Herald</i> has long
been caricatured as <span class="sc lower">MRS. HARRIS</span>, and the <i>Standard</i>
as <span class="sc lower">MRS. GAMP</span>.<a class="marker" id="marker-54" href="#footnote-54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p>The <i>Stage</i>, of course, has its Slang—“both before
and behind the curtain,” as a journalist remarks.
The stage manager is familiarly termed <span class="sc lower">DADDY</span>;
and an actor by profession, or a “professional,” is
called a <span class="sc lower">PRO</span>. A man who is occasionally hired at
a trifling remuneration to come upon the stage as
one of a crowd, or when a number of actors are
wanted to give effect, is named a <span class="sc lower">SUP</span>,—an abbreviation
of “supernumerary.” A <span class="sc lower">SURF</span> is a third-rate
actor who frequently pursues another calling;
<a id="page-76" href="#page-76" class="pagenum" title="76"></a>
and the band, or orchestra between the pit and the
stage, is generally spoken of as the <span class="sc lower">MENAGERY</span>. A
<span class="sc lower">BEN</span> is a benefit; and <span class="sc lower">SAL</span> is the Slang abbreviation
of “salary.” Should no wages be forthcoming
on the Saturday night, it is said that the <span class="sc lower">GHOST
DOESN’T WALK</span>. The travelling or provincial theatricals,
who perform in any large room that can
be rented in a country village, are called <span class="sc lower">BARN
STORMERS</span>. A <span class="sc lower">LENGTH</span> is forty-two lines of any
dramatic composition; and a <span class="sc lower">RUN</span> is the good or
bad success of a performance. A <span class="sc lower">SADDLE</span> is the
additional charge made by a manager to an actor
or actress upon their benefit night. To <span class="sc lower">MUG UP</span> is
to paint one’s face, or arrange the person to represent
a particular character; to <span class="sc lower">CORPSE</span>, or to <span class="sc lower">STICK</span>,
is to balk, or put the other actors out in their parts
by forgetting yours. A performance is spoken of
as either a <span class="sc lower">GOOSER</span> or a <span class="sc lower">SCREAMER</span>, should it be a
failure or a great success;—if the latter, it is not
infrequently termed a <span class="sc lower">HIT</span>. To <span class="sc lower">STAR IT</span> is to perform
as the centre of attraction, with none but
subordinates and indifferent actors in the same
performance. The expressive term <span class="sc lower">CLAP-TRAP</span>,
high-sounding nonsense, is nothing but an ancient
theatrical term, and signified a <span class="sc lower">TRAP</span> to catch a
<span class="sc lower">CLAP</span> by way of applause. “Up amongst the
<span class="sc lower">GODS</span>,” refers to being among the spectators in the
gallery,—termed in French Slang <span class="sc lower">PARADIS</span>.</p>

<p>There exists, too, in the great territory of vulgar
<a id="page-77" href="#page-77" class="pagenum" title="77"></a>
speech what may not inappropriately be termed
<i>Civic Slang</i>. It consists of mercantile and Stock
Exchange terms, and the Slang of good living and
wealth. A turkey hung with sausages is facetiously
styled <span class="sc lower">AN ALDERMAN IN CHAINS</span>; and a half-crown,
perhaps from its rotundity, is often termed
an <span class="sc lower">ALDERMAN</span>. A <span class="sc lower">BEAR</span> is a speculator on the
Exchange; and a <span class="sc lower">BULL</span>, although of another order,
follows a like profession. There is something very
humorous and applicable in the slang term <span class="sc lower">LAME
DUCK</span>, a defaulter in stock-jobbing speculations.
The allusion to his “waddling out of the Alley,”
as they say, is excellent. <span class="sc">Breaking shins</span>, in
City slang, is borrowing money; a rotten or unsound
scheme is spoken of as <span class="sc lower">FISHY</span>; “<span class="sc lower">RIGGING</span>
the market” means playing tricks with it; and
<span class="sc lower">STAG</span> was a common term during the railway mania
for a speculator without capital, a seller of “scrip”
in “Diddlesex Junction” and other equally safe
lines. In Lombard-street a <span class="sc lower">MONKEY</span> is £500, a
<span class="sc lower">PLUM</span> £100,000, and a <span class="sc lower">MARYGOLD</span> is one million
sterling. But before I proceed further in a sketch
of the different kinds of Slang, I cannot do better
than to speak here of the extraordinary number
of Cant and Slang terms in use to represent money,—from
farthings to bank notes the value of fortunes.
<i>Her Majesty’s coin, collectively or in the
piece, is insulted, by no less than one hundred and
thirty distinct Slang words</i>, from the humble
<a id="page-78" href="#page-78" class="pagenum" title="78"></a>
<span class="sc lower">BROWN</span> (a halfpenny) to <span class="sc lower">FLIMSIES</span>, or <span class="sc lower">LONG-TAILED
ONES</span> (bank notes).</p>

<p>“Money,” it has been well remarked, “the bare,
simple word itself, has a sonorous, significant ring
in its sound,” and might have sufficed, one would
have imagined, for all ordinary purposes. But a
vulgar or “fast” society has thought differently,
and so we have the Slang synonymes <span class="sc lower">BEANS</span>,
<span class="sc lower">BLUNT</span>, (<i>i.e.</i>, specie,—not <i>stiff</i> or <i>rags</i>, bank notes),
<span class="sc lower">BRADS</span>, <span class="sc lower">BRASS</span>, <span class="sc lower">BUSTLE</span>, <span class="sc lower">COPPERS</span> (copper money,
or mixed pence), <span class="sc lower">CHINK</span>, <span class="sc lower">CHINKERS</span>, <span class="sc lower">CHIPS</span>, <span class="sc lower">CORKS</span>,
<span class="sc lower">DIBBS</span>, <span class="sc lower">DINARLY</span>, <span class="sc lower">DIMMOCK</span>, <span class="sc lower">DUST</span>, <span class="sc lower">FEATHERS</span>,
<span class="sc lower">GENT</span> (silver,—from <i>argent</i>), <span class="sc lower">HADDOCK</span> (a purse of
money), <span class="sc lower">HORSE NAILS</span>, <span class="sc lower">LOAVER</span>, <span class="sc lower">LOUR</span> (the oldest
Cant term for money), <span class="sc lower">MOPUSSES</span>, <span class="sc lower">NEEDFUL</span>, <span class="sc lower">NOBBINGS</span>
(money collected in a hat by street performers),
<span class="sc lower">OCHRE</span> (gold), <span class="sc lower">PEWTER</span>, <span class="sc lower">PALM OIL</span>,
<span class="sc lower">QUEEN’S PICTURES</span>, <span class="sc lower">QUIDS</span>, <span class="sc lower">RAGS</span> (bank notes),
<span class="sc lower">READY</span>, or <span class="sc lower">READY GILT</span>, <span class="sc lower">REDGE</span> (gold), <span class="sc lower">RHINO</span>,
<span class="sc lower">ROWDY</span>, <span class="sc lower">SHINERS</span> (sovereigns), <span class="sc lower">SKIN</span> (a purse of
money), <span class="sc lower">STIFF</span> (paper, or bill of acceptance), <span class="sc lower">STUFF</span>,
<span class="sc lower">STUMPY</span>, <span class="sc lower">TIN</span> (silver), <span class="sc lower">WEDGE</span> (silver), and <span class="sc lower">YELLOW-BOYS</span>
(sovereigns);—just forty-two vulgar equivalents
for the simple word <i>money</i>. So attentive is
Slang speech to financial matters, that there are
seven terms for bad, or “bogus” coin (as our
friends, the Americans, call it): a <span class="sc lower">CASE</span> is a counterfeit
five-shilling piece; <span class="sc lower">HALF A CASE</span> represents
half that sum; <span class="sc lower">GRAYS</span> are halfpence made double
<a id="page-79" href="#page-79" class="pagenum" title="79"></a>
for gambling purposes; <span class="sc lower">QUEER-SOFT</span> is counterfeit
or lead coin; <span class="sc lower">SCHOFEL</span> refers to coated or spurious
coin; <span class="sc lower">SHEEN</span> is bad money of any description; and
<span class="sc lower">SINKERS</span> bears the same and not inappropriate
meaning. <span class="sc">Flying the kite</span>, or obtaining money
on bills and promissory notes, is a curious allusion
to children tossing about a paper kite; and <span class="sc lower">RAISING
THE WIND</span> is a well-known phrase for procuring
money by immediate sale, pledging, or a forced
loan. In winter or in summer any elderly gentleman
who may have prospered in life is pronounced
<span class="sc lower">WARM</span>; whilst an equivalent is immediately at hand
in the phrase “his pockets are well <span class="sc lower">LINED</span>.” Each
separate piece of money has its own Slang term, and
often half a score of synonymes. To begin with
that extremely humble coin, a <i>farthing</i>: first we
have <span class="sc lower">FADGE</span>, then <span class="sc lower">FIDDLER</span>, then <span class="sc lower">GIG</span>, and lastly
<span class="sc lower">QUARTEREEN</span>. A <i>halfpenny</i> is a <span class="sc lower">BROWN</span> or a
<span class="sc lower">MADZA SALTEE</span> (Cant), or a <span class="sc lower">MAG</span>, or a <span class="sc lower">POSH</span>, or a
<span class="sc lower">RAP</span>,—whence the popular phrase, “I don’t care a
<i>rap</i>.” The useful and universal <i>penny</i> has for Slang
equivalents a <span class="sc lower">COPPER</span>, a <span class="sc lower">SALTEE</span> (Cant), and a
<span class="sc lower">WINN</span>. <i>Two-pence</i> is a <span class="sc lower">DEUCE</span>, and <i>three-pence</i> is
either a <span class="sc lower">THRUMS</span> or a <span class="sc lower">THRUPS</span>. <i>Four-pence</i>, or a
<i>groat</i>, may in vulgar speech he termed a <span class="sc lower">BIT</span>, a
<span class="sc lower">FLAG</span>, or a <span class="sc lower">JOEY</span>. <i>Six-pence</i> is well represented in
street talk, and some of the Slangisms are very
comical, for instance, <span class="sc lower">BANDY</span>, <span class="sc lower">BENDER</span>, <span class="sc lower">CRIPPLE</span>,
and <span class="sc lower">DOWNER</span>; then we have <span class="sc lower">FYE-BUCK</span>, <span class="sc lower">HALF A
<a id="page-80" href="#page-80" class="pagenum" title="80"></a>
HOG</span>, <span class="sc lower">KICK</span> (thus “two and a kick,” or 2s. 6d.),
<span class="sc lower">LORD OF THE MANOR</span>, <span class="sc lower">PIG</span>, <span class="sc lower">POT</span> (the price of a
<i>pot</i> of beer), <span class="sc lower">SNID</span>, <span class="sc lower">SPRAT</span>, <span class="sc lower">SOW’S BABY</span>, <span class="sc lower">TANNER</span>,
<span class="sc lower">TESTER</span>, <span class="sc lower">TIZZY</span>,—sixteen vulgar words to one coin.
<i>Seven-pence</i> being an uncommon amount has only
one Slang synonyme, <span class="sc lower">SETTER</span>. The same remark
applies to <i>eight-pence</i> and <i>nine-pence</i>, the former
being only represented by <span class="sc lower">OTTER</span>, and the latter
by the Cant phrase, <span class="sc lower">NOBBA-SALTEE</span>. <i>Ten-pence</i> is
<span class="sc lower">DACHA-SALTEE</span>, and <i>eleven-pence</i> <span class="sc lower">DACHA-ONE</span>,—both
Cant expressions. <i>One shilling</i> boasts ten
Slang equivalents; thus we have <span class="sc lower">BEONG</span>, <span class="sc lower">BOB</span>,
<span class="sc lower">BREAKY-LEG</span>, <span class="sc lower">DEANER</span>, <span class="sc lower">GEN</span> (either from <i>argent</i>,
silver, or the back slang), <span class="sc lower">HOG</span>, <span class="sc lower">PEG</span>, <span class="sc lower">STAG</span>, <span class="sc lower">TEVISS</span>,
and <span class="sc lower">TWELVER</span>. <i>Half-a-crown</i> is known as an
<span class="sc lower">ALDERMAN</span>, <span class="sc lower">HALF A BULL</span>, <span class="sc lower">HALF A TUSHEROON</span>,
and a <span class="sc lower">MADZA CAROON</span>; whilst a <i>crown</i> piece, or
<i>five shillings</i>, may be called either a <span class="sc lower">BULL</span>, or a
<span class="sc lower">CAROON</span>, or a <span class="sc lower">CARTWHEEL</span>, or a <span class="sc lower">COACHWHEEL</span>,
or a <span class="sc lower">THICK-UN</span>, or a <span class="sc lower">TUSHEROON</span>. The next advance
in Slang money is <i>ten shillings</i>, or <i>half-a-sovereign</i>,
which may be either pronounced as <span class="sc lower">HALF
A BEAN</span>, <span class="sc lower">HALF A COUTER</span>, a <span class="sc lower">MADZA POONA</span>, or
<span class="sc lower">HALF A QUID</span>. A <i>sovereign</i>, or <i>twenty shillings</i>, is
a <span class="sc lower">BEAN</span>, <span class="sc lower">CANARY</span>, <span class="sc lower">COUTER</span>, <span class="sc lower">FOONT</span>, <span class="sc lower">GOLDFINCH</span>,
<span class="sc lower">JAMES</span>, <span class="sc lower">POONA</span>, <span class="sc lower">QUID</span>, a <span class="sc lower">THICK-UN</span>, or a <span class="sc lower">YELLOW-BOY</span>.
<i>Guineas</i> are nearly obsolete, yet the terms
<span class="sc lower">NEDS</span>, and <span class="sc lower">HALF NEDS</span>, are still in use. Bank notes
are <span class="sc lower">FLIMSIES</span>, <span class="sc lower">LONG-TAILED ONES</span>, or <span class="sc lower">SOFT</span>. A
<a id="page-81" href="#page-81" class="pagenum" title="81"></a>
<span class="sc lower">FINUF</span> is a five-pound note. One hundred pounds
(or any other “round sum”) quietly handed over
as payment for services performed is curiously
termed “a <span class="sc lower">COOL</span> hundred.” Thus ends, with
several omissions, this long list of Slang terms for
the coins of the realm, which for copiousness, I
will engage to say, is not equalled by any other
vulgar or unauthorised language in Europe.</p>

<p>The antiquity of many of these Slang names is
remarkable. <span class="sc">Winn</span> was the vulgar term for a
penny in the days of Queen Elizabeth; and <span class="sc lower">TESTER</span>,
a sixpence (formerly a shilling), was the
correct name in the days of Henry the Eighth.
The reader, too, will have remarked the frequency
of animals’ names as Slang terms for
money. Little, as a modern writer has remarked,
do the persons using these phrases know of their
remote and somewhat classical origin, which may,
indeed, be traced to the period antecedent to that
when monarchs monopolised the surface of coined
money with their own image and superscriptions.
They are identical with the very name of money
among the early Romans, which was <i>pecunia</i>, from
<i>pecus</i>, a flock. The collections of coin dealers
amply show that the figure of a <span class="sc lower">HOG</span> was anciently
placed on a small silver coin; and that that of a
<span class="sc lower">BULL</span> decorated larger ones of the same metal.
These coins were frequently deeply crossed on the
reverse; this was for the convenience of easily
<a id="page-82" href="#page-82" class="pagenum" title="82"></a>
breaking them into two or more pieces, should the
bargain for which they were employed require it,
and the parties making it had no smaller change
handy to complete the transaction. Thus we find
that the <span class="sc lower">HALF BULL</span> of the itinerant street seller, or
“traveller,”<a class="marker" id="marker-55" href="#footnote-55"><sup>55</sup></a> so far from being a phrase of modern
invention, as is generally supposed, is in point of
fact referable to an era extremely remote. There
are many other Cant words directly from a classic
source, as will be seen in the Dictionary.</p>

<p><i>Shopkeepers’ Slang</i> is, perhaps, the most offensive
of all Slang. It is not a casual eyesore, as newspaper
Slang, neither is it an occasional discomfort
to the ear, as in the case of some vulgar byeword
of the street; but it is a perpetual nuisance, and
stares you in the face on tradesmen’s invoices, on
labels in the shop-windows, and placards on the
hoardings, in posters against the house next to your
own door—if it happens to be empty for a few
weeks,—and in bills thrust into your hand, as you
peaceably walk through the streets. Under your
doors, and down your area, Slang hand-bills are
dropped by some <span class="sc lower">PUSHING</span> tradesman, and for the
thousandth time you are called upon to learn that
an <span class="sc lower">ALARMING SACRIFICE</span> is taking place in the
next street, that prices are <span class="sc lower">DOWN AGAIN</span>, that in
consequence of some other tradesman not <span class="sc lower">DRIVING</span>
a <span class="sc lower">ROARING TRADE</span>, being in fact <span class="sc lower">SOLD UP</span>, and for
the time being a resident in <span class="sc lower">BURDON’S HOTEL</span>
<a id="page-83" href="#page-83" class="pagenum" title="83"></a>
(Whitecross-street Prison), the <span class="sc lower">PUSHING</span> tradesman
wishes to sell out at <span class="sc lower">AWFULLY LOW PRICES</span>, “to
the kind patrons, and numerous customers,” &amp;c. &amp;c.,
“that have on every occasion,” &amp;c. &amp;c. In this
Slang any occupation or calling is termed a <span class="sc lower">LINE</span>,—thus
the “Building-<span class="sc lower">LINE</span>.” A tailor usurps to
himself a good deal of Slang. Amongst operatives
he is called a <span class="sc lower">SNIP</span>, or a <span class="sc lower">STEEL BAR DRIVER</span>; by
the world, a <span class="sc lower">NINTH PART OF A MAN</span>; and by the
young collegian, or “fast” man, a <span class="sc lower">SUFFERER</span>. If
he takes army contracts, it is <span class="sc lower">SANK WORK</span>; if he
is a <span class="sc lower">SLOP</span> tailor, he is a <span class="sc lower">SPRINGER UP</span>, and his
garments are <span class="sc lower">BLOWN TOGETHER</span>. Perquisites with
him are <span class="sc lower">SPIFFS</span>, and remnants of cloth, <span class="sc lower">PEAKING</span>.
The percentage he allows to his assistants (or
<span class="sc lower">COUNTER JUMPERS</span>) on the sale of old-fashioned
articles, is termed <span class="sc lower">TINGE</span>. If he pays his workmen
in goods, or gives them tickets upon other tradesmen,
with whom he shares the profit, he is soon known
as a <span class="sc lower">TOMMY MASTER</span>. If his business succeeds, it
<span class="sc lower">TAKES</span>; if neglected, it becomes <span class="sc lower">SHAKY</span>, and <span class="sc lower">GOES
TO POT</span>; if he is deceived by a creditor (a not by
any means unusual circumstance) he is <span class="sc lower">LET IN</span>, or,
as it is sometimes varied, <span class="sc lower">TAKEN IN</span>. I need
scarcely remark that any credit he may give is
termed <span class="sc lower">TICK</span>.</p>

<p><i>Operatives’ or Workmen’s Slang</i>, in quality, is but
slightly removed from tradesmen’s Slang. When
belonging to the same shop or factory, they <span class="sc lower">GRAFT</span>
<a id="page-84" href="#page-84" class="pagenum" title="84"></a>
there, and are <span class="sc lower">BROTHER CHIPS</span>. They generally
dine at <span class="sc lower">SLAP BANG SHOPS</span>, and are often paid at
<span class="sc lower">TOMMY SHOPS</span>. At the nearest <span class="sc lower">PUB</span>, or public-house,
they generally have a <span class="sc lower">SCORE CHALKED UP</span>
against them, which has to be <span class="sc lower">WIPED OFF</span> regularly
on the Saturday night. When out of work, they
borrow a word from the flunkey vocabulary, and
describe themselves as being <span class="sc lower">OUT OF COLLAR</span>.
They term each other <span class="sc lower">FLINTS</span> and <span class="sc lower">DUNGS</span>, if they
are “society” or “non-society” men. Their salary
is a <span class="sc lower">SCREW</span>, and to be discharged is to <span class="sc lower">GET THE
SACK</span>. When they quit work, they <span class="sc lower">KNOCK OFF</span>;
and when out of employ, they ask if any <span class="sc lower">HANDS</span>
are wanted. <span class="sc">Fat</span> is the vulgar synonyme for
perquisites; <span class="sc lower">ELBOW-GREASE</span> signifies labour; and
<span class="sc lower">SAINT MONDAY</span> is the favourite day of the week.
Names of animals figure plentifully in the workman’s
vocabulary; thus we have <span class="sc lower">GOOSE</span>, a tailor’s
smoothing iron; <span class="sc lower">SHEEP’S-FOOT</span>, an iron hammer;
<span class="sc lower">SOW,</span> a receptacle for molten iron, whilst the metal
poured from it is termed <span class="sc lower">PIG</span>. I have often
thought that many of the Slang terms for money
originally came from the workshop, thus—<span class="sc lower">BRADS</span>,
from the ironmonger; <span class="sc lower">CHIPS</span>, from the carpenter;
<span class="sc lower">DUST</span>, from the goldsmith; <span class="sc lower">FEATHERS</span>, from the
upholsterer; <span class="sc lower">HORSE NAILS</span>, from the farrier; <span class="sc lower">HADDOCK</span>,
from the fishmonger; and <span class="sc lower">TANNER</span>, from the
leather-dresser. The subject is curious. Allow me
to call the attention of numismatists to it.</p>
<a id="page-85" href="#page-85" class="pagenum" title="85"></a>

<p>There yet remain several distinct divisions of
Slang to be examined;—the Slang of the <i>stable</i>, or
<i>jockey</i> Slang; the Slang of the <i>prize ring</i>; the Slang
of <i>servitude</i>, or <i>flunkeydom</i>; vulgar, or <i>street</i> Slang;
the Slang of <i>softened oaths</i>; and the Slang of
<i>intoxication</i>. I shall only examine the last two.
If society, as has been remarked, is a sham, from
the vulgar foundation of commonalty to the crowning
summit of royalty, especially do we perceive
the justness of the remark in the Slang makeshifts
for oaths, and sham exclamations for passion and
temper. These apologies for feeling are a disgrace
to our vernacular, although it is some satisfaction to
know that they serve the purpose of reducing the
stock of national profanity. “You <span class="sc lower">BE BLOWED</span>,”
or “I’ll <span class="sc lower">BE BLOWED IF</span>,” &amp;c., is an exclamation
often heard in the streets. <span class="sc">Blazes</span>, or “like
<span class="sc lower">BLAZES</span>,” came probably from the army. <span class="sc">Blast</span>,
too, although in general vulgar use, may have had
a like origin; so may the phrase, “I wish I may be
<span class="sc lower">SHOT</span>, if,” &amp;c. <span class="sc">Blow me tight</span>, is a very windy
and common exclamation. The same may be said
of <span class="sc lower">STRIKE ME LUCKY</span>, <span class="sc lower">NEVER TRUST ME</span>, and
<span class="sc lower">SO HELP ME DAVY</span>; the latter derived from the
truer old phrase, <span class="sc lower">I’LL TAKE MY DAVY ON’T</span>, <i>i.e.</i>,
my <i>affidavit</i>, <span class="sc lower">DAVY</span> being a corruption of that word.
<span class="sc">By golly</span>, <span class="sc lower">GOL DARN IT</span>, and <span class="sc lower">SO HELP ME BOB</span>,
are evident shams for profane oaths. <span class="sc">Nation</span> is
but a softening of <i>damnation</i>; and <span class="sc lower">OD</span>, whether
<a id="page-86" href="#page-86" class="pagenum" title="86"></a>
used in <span class="sc lower">OD DRAT IT</span>, or <span class="sc lower">OD’S BLOOD</span>, is but an
apology for the name of the Deity. The Irish
phrase, <span class="sc lower">BAD SCRAN TO YER!</span> is equivalent to wishing
a person bad food. “I’m <span class="sc lower">SNIGGERED</span> if you
will,” and “I’m <span class="sc lower">JIGGERED</span>,” are other stupid forms
of mild swearing,—fearful of committing an open
profanity, yet slyly nibbling at the sin. Both
<span class="sc lower">DEUCE</span> and <span class="sc lower">DICKENS</span> are vulgar old synonymes for
the devil; and <span class="sc lower">ZOUNDS</span> is an abbreviation of <span class="sc lower">GOD’S
WOUNDS</span>,—a very ancient catholic oath.</p>

<p>In a casual survey of the territory of Slang, it is
curious to observe how well represented are the
familiar wants and failings of life. First, there’s
money, with one hundred and twenty Slang terms
and synonymes; then comes drink, from small
beer to champagne; and next, as a very natural
sequence, <i>intoxication</i>, and fuddlement generally,
with some half a hundred vulgar terms, graduating
the scale of drunkenness from a slight inebriation,
to the soaky state of gutterdom and stretcherdom,—I
pray the reader to forgive the expressions.
The Slang synonymes for mild intoxication are
certainly very choice,—they are <span class="sc lower">BEERY</span>, <span class="sc lower">BEMUSED</span>,
<span class="sc lower">BOOZY</span>, <span class="sc lower">BOSKY</span>, <span class="sc lower">BUFFY</span>, <span class="sc lower">CORNED</span>, <span class="sc lower">FOGGY</span>, <span class="sc lower">FOU</span>,
<span class="sc lower">FRESH</span>, <span class="sc lower">HAZY</span>, <span class="sc lower">ELEVATED</span>, <span class="sc lower">KISKY</span>, <span class="sc lower">LUSHY</span>,
<span class="sc lower">MOONY</span>, <span class="sc lower">MUGGY</span>, <span class="sc lower">MUZZY</span>, <span class="sc lower">ON</span>, <span class="sc lower">SCREWED</span>, <span class="sc lower">STEWED</span>,
<span class="sc lower">TIGHT</span>, and <span class="sc lower">WINEY</span>. A higher or more intense
state of beastliness is represented by the expressions,
<span class="sc lower">PODGY</span>, <span class="sc lower">BEARGERED</span>, <span class="sc lower">BLUED</span>, <span class="sc lower">CUT</span>, <span class="sc lower">PRIMED</span>,
<a id="page-87" href="#page-87" class="pagenum" title="87"></a>
<span class="sc lower">LUMPY</span>, <span class="sc lower">PLOUGHED</span>, <span class="sc lower">MUDDLED</span>, <span class="sc lower">OBFUSCATED</span>,
<span class="sc lower">SWIPEY</span>, <span class="sc lower">THREE SHEETS IN THE WIND</span>, and <span class="sc lower">TOP-HEAVY</span>.
But the climax of fuddlement is only
obtained when the <span class="sc lower">DISGUISED</span> individual <span class="sc lower">CAN’T
SEE A HOLE IN A LADDER</span>, or when he is all
<span class="sc lower">MOPS AND BROOMS</span>, or <span class="sc lower">OFF HIS NUT</span>, or with his
<span class="sc lower">MAIN-BRACE WELL SPLICED</span>, or with the <span class="sc lower">SUN IN
HIS EYES</span>, or when he has <span class="sc lower">LAPPED THE GUTTER</span>,
and got the <span class="sc lower">GRAVEL RASH</span>, or on the <span class="sc lower">RAN-TAN</span>, or
on the <span class="sc lower">RE-RAW</span>, or when he is <span class="sc lower">SEWED UP</span>, or
regularly <span class="sc lower">SCAMMERED</span>,—then, and not till then,
is he entitled in vulgar society to the title of
<span class="sc lower">LUSHINGTON</span>, or recommended to <span class="sc lower">PUT IN THE
PIN</span>.</p>

A 1.“—<i>Sam Slick.</i> The highest classification of ships at
Lloyd’s; common term in the United States, also at Liverpool
and other English seaports. Another, even more
intensitive form, is “first-class, letter A, No. 1.”</p>

<p>ABOUT RIGHT, “to do the thing <span class="sc lower">ABOUT RIGHT</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, to do it
properly, soundly, correctly; “he guv it ’im <span class="sc lower">ABOUT RIGHT</span>,”
<i>i.e.</i>, he beat him severely.</p>

<p>ABRAM-SHAM, or <span class="sc lower">SHAM-ABRAHAM</span>, to feign sickness or distress.
From <span class="sc lower">ABRAM MAN</span>, the <i>ancient cant</i> term for a begging

When Abraham Newland was Cashier of the Bank of England,
and signed their notes, it was sung:—</p>

  <div class="line i6">“I have heard people say</div>
  <div class="line i6">That <span class="sc lower">SHAM ABRAHAM</span> you may,</div>
  <div class="line">But you mustn’t <span class="sc lower">SHAM ABRAHAM</span> Newland.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>ABSQUATULATE, to run away, or abscond; a hybrid <i>American</i>
expression, from the Latin <i>ab</i>, and “squat,” to settle.</p>

<p>ADAM’S ALE, water.—<i>English.</i> The Scotch term is <span class="sc lower">ADAM’S WINE</span>.</p>

<p>AGGERAWATORS (corruption of <i>Aggravators</i>), the greasy
locks of hair in vogue among costermongers and other
street folk, worn twisted from the temple back towards
<a id="page-90" href="#page-90" class="pagenum" title="90"></a>
the ear. They are also, from a supposed resemblance in
form, termed <span class="sc lower"><a href="#newgate-knocker">NEWGATE KNOCKERS</a></span>, which see.—<i>Sala’s Gas-light</i>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>ALDERMAN, a half-crown—possibly from its rotundity.</p>

<p>ALL MY EYE, answer of astonishment to an improbable story;
<span class="sc lower">ALL MY EYE AND BETTY MARTIN</span>, a vulgar phrase with similar
meaning, said to be the commencement of a Popish prayer
to St. Martin, “Oh mihi, beate Martine,” and fallen into
discredit at the Reformation.</p>

<p>ALL-OVERISH, neither sick nor well, the premonitory symptoms
of illness.</p>

<p>ALL-ROUNDERS, the fashionable shirt collars of the present
time worn meeting in front.</p>

<p>ALLS, tap-droppings, refuse spirits sold at a cheap rate in gin-palaces.—<i>See</i> <span class="sc lower"><a href="#loveage">LOVEAGE</a></span>.</p>

<p>ALL-THERE, in strict fashion, first-rate, “up to the mark;” a
vulgar person would speak of a spruce, showily-dressed
female as being <span class="sc lower">ALL-THERE</span>. An artizan would use the
same phrase to express the capabilities of a skilful fellow
workman.</p>

<p>ALL TO PIECES, utterly, excessively; “he beat him <span class="sc lower">ALL TO
PIECES</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, excelled or surpassed him exceedingly.</p>

<p>ALL TO SMASH, or <span class="sc lower">GONE TO PIECES</span>, bankrupt, or smashed to
pieces.—<i>Somersetshire.</i></p>

<p>ALMIGHTY DOLLAR, an <i>American</i> expression for the “power
of money,” first introduced by Washington Irving in 1837.</p>

<p>AN’T, or <span class="sc lower">AÏN’T</span>, the vulgar abbreviation of “am not,” or “are

<p>ARGOT, a term used amongst London thieves for their secret
or cant language. <i>French</i> term for slang.</p>

<p>ARTICLE, a man or boy, derisive term.</p>

<p>ARY, corruption of ever a, e’er a; <span class="sc lower">ARY ONE</span>, e’er a one.</p>

<p>ATTACK, to carve, or commence operations on; “<span class="sc lower">ATTACK</span> that
beef, and oblige!”</p>

<p>ATTIC, the head; “queer in the <span class="sc lower">ATTIC</span>,” intoxicated.—<i>Pugilistic.</i></p>

<p>AUNT-SALLY, a favourite game on race-courses and at fairs,
consisting of a wooden head mounted on a stick, firmly
fixed in the ground; in the nose of which, or rather in that
part of the facial arrangement of <span class="sc lower">AUNT SALLY</span> which is
generally considered incomplete without a nasal projection, a
tobacco pipe is inserted. The fun consists in standing at a
distance and demolishing <span class="sc lower">AUNT SALLY’S</span> pipe-clay projection
with short bludgeons, very similar to the half of a broom-handle.
The Duke of Beaufort is a “crack hand” at smashing
pipe noses, and his performances two years ago on
Brighton race-course are yet fresh in remembrance. The
noble Duke, in the summer months, frequently drives the
old London and Brighton four-horse mail coach, “Age”—a
whim singular enough now, but common forty years ago.<!--TN: deleted extraneous quotation mark--></p>

<p>AUTUMN, a slang term for an execution by hanging. When
the drop was introduced instead of the old gallows, cart, and
ladder, and a man was for the first time “turned-off” in
the present fashion, the mob were so pleased with the
invention that they spoke of the operation as at <span class="sc lower">AUTUMN</span>,
or the <span class="sc lower">FALL OF THE LEAF</span> (<i>sc.</i> the drop), with the man
about to be hung.</p>

<p>AVAST, a sailor’s phrase for stop, shut up, go away,—apparently
connected with the <i>old cant</i>, <span class="sc lower">BYNGE A WASTE</span>.</p>

<p>AWAKE, or <span class="sc lower">FLY</span>, knowing, thoroughly understanding, not
ignorant of. The phrase <span class="sc lower">WIDE AWAKE</span> carries the same
meaning in ordinary conversation.</p>

<p>AWFUL (or, with the Cockneys, <span class="sc lower">ORFUL</span>), a senseless expletive,
used to intensify a description of anything good or bad;
“what an <span class="sc lower">AWFUL</span> fine woman!” <i>i.e.</i>, how handsome, or
showy!</p>

<p>AXE, to ask.—<i>Saxon</i>, <span class="sc lower">ACSIAN</span>.</p>

<p id="babes">BABES, the lowest order of <span class="sc lower"><a href="#knock-outs">KNOCK-OUTS</a></span> (which see), who are
prevailed upon not to give opposing biddings at auctions, in
consideration of their receiving a small sum (from one
shilling to half-a-crown), and a certain quantity of beer.
<span class="sc">Babes</span> exist in Baltimore, U.S., where they are known as
blackguards and “rowdies.”</p>
<a id="page-92" href="#page-92" class="pagenum" title="92"></a>

<p>BACK JUMP, a back window.</p>

<p>BACK SLANG IT, to go out the back way.</p>

<p>BACK OUT, to retreat from a difficulty; the reverse of <span class="sc lower">GO
AHEAD</span>. Metaphor borrowed from the stables.</p>

<p>BACON, “to save one’s <span class="sc lower">BACON</span>,” to escape.</p>

<p>BAD, “to go to the <span class="sc lower">BAD</span>,” to deteriorate in character, be ruined.
<i>Virgil</i> has an exactly similar phrase, <i>in pejus ruere</i>.</p>

<p>BAGMAN, a commercial traveller.</p>

<p id="bags">BAGS, trowsers. Trowsers of an extensive pattern, or exaggerated
fashionable cut, have lately been termed <span class="sc lower">HOWLING-BAGS</span>,
but only when the style has been very “<i>loud</i>.” The
word is probably an abbreviation for b—mbags. “To have
the <span class="sc lower">BAGS</span> off,” to be of age and one’s own master, to have
plenty of money.</p>

<p>BAKE, “he’s only <span class="sc lower">HALF BAKED</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, soft, inexperienced.</p>

<p>BAKER’S DOZEN. This consists of thirteen or fourteen; the
surplus number, called the <i>inbread</i>, being thrown in for
fear of incurring the penalty for short weight. To “give a
man a <span class="sc lower">BAKER’S DOZEN</span>,” in a slang sense, means to give him
an extra good beating or pummelling.</p>

<p>BALAAM, printers’ slang for matter kept in type about monstrous
productions of nature, &amp;c., to fill up spaces in newspapers
that would otherwise be vacant. The term <span class="sc lower">BALAAM-BOX</span>
has long been used in <i>Blackwood</i> as the name of the
depository for rejected articles.</p>

<p>BALL, prison allowance, viz., six ounces of meat.</p>

<p>BALLYRAG, to scold vehemently, to swindle one out of his
money by intimidation and sheer abuse, as alleged in a late
cab case (<i>Evans</i> v. <i>Robinson</i>).</p>

<p>BALMY, insane.</p>

<p>BAMBOOZLE, to deceive, make fun of, or cheat a person;
abbreviated to <span class="sc lower">BAM</span>, which is used also as a substantive,
a deception, a sham, a “sell.” <i>Swift</i> says <span class="sc lower">BAMBOOZLE</span> was
invented by a nobleman in the reign of Charles II.; but
this I conceive to be an error. The probability is that a
nobleman first <i>used</i> it in polite society. The term is derived
from the <i>Gipseys</i>.</p>

<p>BANDED, hungry.</p>

<p>BANDY, or <span class="sc lower">CRIPPLE</span>, a sixpence, so called from this coin being

by <i>Grose</i>, to be a cant term.</p>

rations; probably derived from the <span class="sc lower">BANIANS</span>, a Hindoo
caste, who abstain from animal food.—<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p>BAR, or <span class="sc lower">BARRING</span>, excepting; in common use in the betting-ring;
“I bet against the field <span class="sc lower">BAR</span> two.” The Irish use of
<span class="sc lower">BARRIN’</span> is very similar.</p>

<p>BARKER, a man employed to cry at the doors of “gaffs,” shows,
and puffing shops, to entice people inside.</p>

<p>BARKING IRONS, pistols.</p>

<p>BARNACLES, a pair of spectacles; corruption of <span class="sc lower">BINOCULI</span>?</p>

<p>BARN-STORMERS, theatrical performers who travel the
country and act in barns, selecting short and frantic pieces
to suit the rustic taste.—<i>Theatrical.</i></p>

<p>BARRIKIN, jargon, speech, or discourse; “we can’t tumble to
that <span class="sc lower">BARRIKIN</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, we don’t understand what he says.
<i>Miege</i> calls it “a sort of stuff.”</p>

<p id="bash">BASH, to beat, thrash; “<span class="sc lower">BASHING</span> a donna,” beating a woman;
originally a provincial word, and chiefly applied to the
practice of beating walnut trees, when in bud, with long
poles, to increase their productiveness. Hence the West
country proverb—</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="line">“A woman, a whelp, and a walnut tree,</div>
  <div class="line">The more you <span class="sc lower">BASH</span> ’em, the better they be.”</div>
</div>
</div>

Fielding was called the <span class="sc lower">BLIND-BEAK</span> in the last century
<a id="page-94" href="#page-94" class="pagenum" title="94"></a>
Query, if connected with the Italian <span class="sc lower">BECCO</span>, which means a
(bird’s) <i>beak</i>, and also a <i>blockhead</i>.</p>

<p>BEAKER-HUNTER, a stealer of poultry.</p>

<p id="beans">BEANS, money; “a haddock of <span class="sc lower">BEANS</span>,” a purse of money;

also used as a synonyme for <span class="sc lower"><a href="#brick">BRICK</a></span>, which see.</p>

<p id="bear">BEAR, one who contracts to deliver or sell a certain quantity of
stock in the public funds on a forthcoming day at a stated
place, but who does not possess it, trusting to a decline in
public securities to enable him to fulfil the agreement and
realise a profit.—<i>See</i> <span class="sc lower"><a href="#bull">BULL</a></span>. Both words are slang terms on
the Stock Exchange, and are frequently used in the business
columns of newspapers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“He who sells that of which he is not possessed is proverbially
said to sell the skin before he has caught the <span class="sc lower">BEAR</span>. It was the
practice of stock-jobbers, in the year 1720, to enter into a contract
for transferring South Sea Stock at a future time for a certain
price; but he who contracted to sell had frequently no stock to
transfer, nor did he who bought intend to receive any in consequence
of his bargain; the seller was, therefore, called a <span class="sc lower">BEAR</span>, in allusion
to the proverb, and the buyer a <span class="sc lower">BULL</span>, perhaps only as a similar
distinction. The contract was merely a wager, to be determined by
the rise or fall of stock; if it rose, the seller paid the difference to
the buyer, proportioned to the sum determined by the same computation
to the seller.”—<i>Dr. Warton on Pope.</i></p>

very quickly. Originally <span class="sc lower">BED-STAFF</span>, a stick placed vertically

place.—<i>Shadwell’s Virtuoso</i>, 1676, act i., scene 1. This was
used sometimes as a defensive weapon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“A cant word amongst the vulgar, by which is implied a dirty fellow
of the meanest kind, Dr. Johnson says, and he cites only the
modern authority of Swift. But the introduction of this word into
our language belongs not to the vulgar, and is more than a century
prior to the time of Swift. Mr. Malone agrees with me in
exhibiting the two first of the following examples. The <i>black-guard</i>
is evidently designed to imply a fit attendant on the devil. Mr.
Gifford, however, in his late edition of Ben Jonson’s works, assigns
an origin of the name different from what the old examples
which I have cited seem to countenance. It has been formed,
he says, from those ‘mean and dirty dependants, in great houses,
who were selected to carry coals to the kitchen, halls, &amp;c. To this
smutty regiment, who attended the progresses, and rode in the
carts with the pots and kettles, which, with every other article of
furniture, were then moved from palace to palace, the people, in
derision, gave the name of <i>black guards</i>; a term since become
sufficiently familiar, and never properly explained.’—Ben Jonson,
ii. 169, vii. 250”—<i>Todd’s Johnson’s Dictionary.</i></p>

most useful animal, well adapted for the ends for which nature

awakening attention to the cause which he advocates, and obtains
that hearing which is granted him at last for self-protection, as
the minor evil compared to his importunity, but which is requisite
to make his cause understood.”</p>

<p>BRUISER, a fighting man, a pugilist.—<i>Pugilistic.</i> <i>Shakespere</i>
uses the word <span class="sc lower">BRUISING</span> in a similar sense.</p>

<p>BRUMS, counterfeit coins. <i>Nearly obsolete.</i> Corruption of
<i>Brummagem</i> (Bromwicham), the ancient name of <i>Birmingham</i>,
the great emporium of plated goods and imitation
jewellery.</p>

<p>BRUSH, or <span class="sc lower">BRUSH-OFF</span>, to run away, or move on.—<i>Old cant.</i></p>

<p>BUB, drink of any kind.—<i>See</i> <span class="sc lower"><a href="#grub">GRUB</a></span>. <i>Middleton</i>, the dramatist,
mentions <span class="sc lower">BUBBER</span>, a great drinker.</p>

<p>BUB, a teat, woman’s breast.</p>

<p>BUCK, a gay or smart man, a cuckold.</p>
<a id="page-106" href="#page-106" class="pagenum" title="106"></a>

<p>BUCKHORSE, a smart blow or box on the ear; derived from
the name of a celebrated “bruiser” of that name.</p>

<p>BUCKLE, to bend; “I can’t <span class="sc lower">BUCKLE</span> to that,” I don’t understand
it; to yield or give in to a person. <i>Shakespere</i> uses the
word in the latter sense, Henry IV., i. 1; and <i>Halliwell</i> says
that “the commentators do not supply another example.”
How strange that in our own streets the term should be
used every day! Stop the first costermonger, and he will
soon inform you the various meanings of <span class="sc lower">BUCKLE</span>.—<i>See
Notes and Queries</i>, vols. vii., viii., and ix.</p>

<p>BUCKLE-TO, to bend to one’s work, to begin at once, and
with great energy.</p>

<p>BUDGE, to move, to inform, to <span class="sc lower">SPLIT</span>, or tell tales.</p>

word for boasting, 1582.</p>

<p>BUFF, the bare skin; “stripped to the <span class="sc lower">BUFF</span>.”</p>

<p>BUFFER, a dog. Their skins were formerly in great request—hence
the term, <span class="sc lower">BUFF</span> meaning in old English <i>to skin</i>. It is
still used in the ring, <span class="sc lower">BUFFED</span> meaning stripped to the skin.
In Irish cant, <span class="sc lower">BUFFER</span> is a <i>boxer</i>. The <span class="sc lower">BUFFER</span> of a railway
carriage doubtless received its very appropriate name from
the old pugilistic application of this term.</p>

<p>BUFFER, a familiar expression for a jolly acquaintance, probably
from the <i>French</i>, <span class="sc lower">BOUFFARD</span>, a fool or clown; a “jolly
old <span class="sc lower">BUFFER</span>,” said of a good humoured or liberal old man.
In 1737, a <span class="sc lower">BUFFER</span> was a “rogue that killed good sound
horses for the sake of their skins, by running a long wire
into them.”—<i>Bacchus and Venus.</i> The term was once applied
to those who took false oaths for a consideration.</p>

<p>BUFFLE HEAD, a stupid or obtuse person.—<i>Miege.</i> <i>German</i>,
<span class="sc lower">BUFFEL-HAUPT</span>, buffalo-headed.</p>

<p>BUFFY, intoxicated.—<i>Household Words</i>, No. 183.</p>

in Ireland.</p>

<p>BUG-HUNTERS, low wretches who plunder drunken men.</p>

dress, &amp;c.; “it’s a tidy <span class="sc lower">BUILD</span>, who made it?”</p>

<p>BULGER, large; synonymous with <span class="sc lower">BUSTER</span>.</p>

<p id="bull">BULL, term amongst prisoners for the meat served to them in
jail.</p>

<p>BULL, one who agrees to purchase stock at a future day, at a
<a id="page-107" href="#page-107" class="pagenum" title="107"></a>
stated price, but who does not possess money to pay for it,
trusting to a rise in public securities to render the transaction
a profitable one. Should stocks fall, the bull is then
called upon to pay the difference.—<i>See</i> <span class="sc lower"><a href="#bear">BEAR</a></span>, who is the
opposite of a <span class="sc lower">BULL</span>, the former selling, the latter purchasing—the
one operating for a <i>fall</i> or a <i>pull down</i>, whilst the
other operates for a <i>rise</i> or <i>toss up</i>.</p>

<p>BULL, a crown piece; formerly, <span class="sc lower">BULL’S EYE</span>.</p>

<p>BULL-THE-CASK, to pour hot water into an empty rum
puncheon, and let it stand until it extracts the spirit from
the wood. The result is drunk by sailors in default of
something stronger.—<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p>BULLY, a braggart; but in the language of the streets, a man
of the most degraded morals, who protects prostitutes, and
lives off their miserable earnings.—<i>Shakespere</i>, Midsummer
Night’s Dream, iii. 1; iv. 2.</p>

<p>BUM, the part on which we sit.—<i>Shakespere.</i> <span class="sc">Bumbags</span>, trowsers.</p>

<p>BUM-BAILIFF, a sheriff’s officer,—a term, some say, derived
from the proximity which this gentleman generally maintains
to his victims. <i>Blackstone</i> says it is a corruption of
“bound bailiff.”</p>

<p>BUM-BOATS, shore boats which supply ships with provisions,
and serve as means of communication between the sailors
and the shore.</p>

<p>BUM-BRUSHER, a schoolmaster.</p>

<p>BUMMAREE. This term is given to a class of speculating
salesmen at Billingsgate market, not recognised as such by
the trade, but who get a living by buying large quantities
of fish of the salesmen and re-selling it to smaller buyers.
The word has been used in the statutes and bye-laws of
the markets for upwards of 100 years. It has been variously
derived, but is most probably from the <i>French</i>, <span class="sc lower">BONNE
MAREE</span>, good fresh fish! “Marée signifie toute sorte de
poisson de mer qûi n’est pas salé; bonne marée—<i>marée
fraiche</i>, vendeur de marée.”—<i>Dict. de l’Acad. Franc.</i> The
<span class="sc lower">BUMMAREES</span> are accused of many trade tricks. One of them
is to blow up cod-fish with a pipe until they look double
their actual size. Of course when the fish come to table
they are flabby, sunken, and half dwindled away. In Norwich,
<span class="sc lower">TO BUMMAREE ONE</span> is to run up a score at a public
house just open, and is equivalent to “running into debt
with one.”</p>

<p>BUNCH OF FIVES, the hand, or fist.</p>
<a id="page-108" href="#page-108" class="pagenum" title="108"></a>

any action; <span class="sc lower">BUNG UP</span>, to close up—<i>Pugilistic</i>; “<span class="sc lower">BUNG</span>

and Fletcher</i>, and <i>Shakespere</i>. Also, to deceive one by
a lie, to <span class="sc lower"><a href="#cram">CRAM</a></span>, which see.</p>

<p>BUNKER, beer.</p>

<p>BUNTS, costermonger’s perquisites; the money obtained by
giving light weight, &amp;c.; costermongers’ goods sold by
boys on commission. Probably a corruption of <i>bonus</i>,
<span class="sc lower">BONE</span> being the slang for good. <span class="sc">Bunce</span>, <i>Grose</i> gives as the
cant word for money.</p>

<p>BURDON’S HOTEL, Whitecross-street prison, of which the
Governor is or was a Mr. Burdon.</p>

<p id="burerk">BURERK, a lady. <i>Grose</i> gives <span class="sc lower">BURICK</span>, a prostitute.</p>

who with others used to waylay people, kill them, and sell
their bodies for dissection at the hospitals.</p>

informing against accomplices when in custody.</p>

twopenny loaf. “A pennorth o’ <span class="sc lower">BEES WAX</span> (cheese) and a
penny <span class="sc lower">BUSTER</span>,” a common snack at beershops.</p>

<p>BUSTER, an extra size; “what a <span class="sc lower">BUSTER</span>,” what a large one;
“in for a <span class="sc lower">BUSTER</span>,” determined on an extensive frolic or
spree. <i>Scotch</i>, <span class="sc lower">BUSTUOUS</span>; <i>Icelandic</i>, <span class="sc lower">BOSTRA</span>.</p>

<p>BUTTON, a decoy, sham purchaser, &amp;c. At any mock or sham
auction seedy specimens may be seen. Probably from the
connection of <i>buttons</i> with <i>Brummagem</i>, which is often used
as a synonyme for a sham.</p>

<p>BUTTONER, a man who entices another to play.—<i>See</i> <span class="sc lower"><a href="#bonnetter">BONNETTER</a></span>.</p>

<p>BUTTONS, a page,—from the rows of gilt buttons which adorn
his jacket.</p>

<p>BUTTONS, “not to have all one’s <span class="sc lower">BUTTONS</span>,” to be deficient in
intellect.</p>

<p>BUZ, to pick pockets; <span class="sc lower">BUZ-FAKING</span>, robbing.</p>

<p>BUZ, to share equally the last of a bottle of wine, when there
is not enough for a full glass for each of the party.</p>

<p>BUZZERS, pickpockets. <i>Grose</i> gives <span class="sc lower">BUZ COVE</span> and <span class="sc lower">BUZ GLOAK</span>,
the latter is very ancient cant.</p>

<p>BUZ-BLOAK, a pickpocket, who principally confines his attention
to purses and loose cash. <i>Grose</i> gives <span class="sc lower">BUZ-GLOAK</span> (or
<span class="sc lower">CLOAK</span>?), an ancient cant word. <span class="sc">Buz-napper</span>, a young pickpocket.</p>

<p>BUZ-NAPPER’S ACADEMY, a school in which young thieves
are trained. Figures are dressed up, and experienced tutors
stand in various difficult attitudes for the boys to practice
upon. When clever enough they are sent on the streets.
It is reported that a house of this nature is situated in a
court near Hatton Garden. The system is well explained
in <i>Dickens’ Oliver Twist</i>.</p>

<p>BYE-BLOW, a bastard child.</p>

<p>BY GEORGE, an exclamation similar to <span class="sc lower">BY JOVE</span>. The term is
older than is frequently imagined, vide <i>Bacchus and Venus</i>
(p. 117), 1737. “Fore (or by) <span class="sc lower">GEORGE</span>, I’d knock him
down.” A street compliment to Saint George, the patron
Saint of England, or possibly to the House of Hanover.</p>

<p>BY GOLLY, an ejaculation, or oath; a compromise for “by
God.” In the United States, small boys are permitted by
their guardians to say <span class="sc lower">GOL DARN</span> anything, but they are on
no account allowed to commit the profanity of G—d d——g
anything. An effective ejaculation and moral waste pipe
for interior passion or wrath is seen in the exclamation—<span class="sc lower">BY
THE-EVER-LIVING-JUMPING-MOSES</span>—a harmless phrase,
that from its length expends a considerable quantity of
fiery anger.</p>
<a id="page-110" href="#page-110" class="pagenum" title="110"></a>

<p>CAB, in statutory language, “a hackney carriage drawn by one
horse.” Abbreviated from <span class="sc lower">CABRIOLET</span>, <i>French</i>; originally
meaning “a light low chaise.” The wags of Paris playing
upon the word (quasi <i>cabri</i> au lait) used to call a superior
turn-out of the kind a <i>cabri au crême</i>. Our abbreviation,
which certainly smacks of slang, has been stamped with the
authority of “<span class="sc">George</span>, <i>Ranger</i>.” See the notices affixed
to the carriage entrances of St. James’s Park.</p>

<p>CAB, to stick together, to muck, or tumble up.—<i>Devonshire.</i></p>

<p>CABBAGE, pieces of cloth said to be purloined by tailors.</p>

<p>CABBAGE, to pilfer or purloin. Termed by Johnson a cant
word, but adopted by later lexicographers as a respectable
term. Said to have been first used in this sense by <i>Arbuthnot</i>.</p>

<p>CABBY, the driver of a cab.</p>

<p>CAD, or <span class="sc lower">CADGER</span> (from which it is shortened), a mean or vulgar
fellow; a beggar; one who would rather live on other
people than work for himself; a man trying to worm something
out of another, either money or information. <i>Johnson</i>
uses the word, and gives <i>huckster</i> as the meaning, but I
never heard it used in this sense. <span class="sc">Cager</span>, or <span class="sc lower">GAGER</span>, the
<i>old cant</i> term for a man. The exclusives in the Universities
apply the term <span class="sc lower">CAD</span> to all non-members.</p>

<p>CAD, an omnibus conductor.</p>

<p>CADGE, to beg in an artful or wheedling manner.—<i>North.</i></p>

<p>CADGING, begging of the lowest degree.</p>

one could relish. <i>Grose</i> gives <span class="sc lower">CAGG MAGGS</span>, old and tough
Lincolnshire geese, sent to London to feast the poor
cockneys.</p>

<p>CAGE, a minor kind of prison.—<i>Shakespere</i>, part ii. of
Henry IV., iv. 2.</p>

<p>CAMESA, shirt or chemise.—<i>Span.</i> <i>Ancient cant</i>, <span class="sc lower">COMMISSION</span>.</p>

<p>CAMISTER, a preacher, clergyman, or master.</p>

<p>CANARY, a sovereign. This is stated by a correspondent to be
a Norwich term, that city being famous for its breed of
those birds.</p>

<p>CANISTER, the head.—<i>Pugilistic.</i></p>
<a id="page-111" href="#page-111" class="pagenum" title="111"></a>

<p>CANISTER-CAP, a hat.—<i>Pugilistic.</i></p>

<p>CANNIKEN, a small can, similar to <span class="sc lower">PANNIKIN</span>.—<i>Shakespere.</i></p>

<p>CANT, a blow or toss; “a cant over the kisser,” a blow on the
mouth.—<i>Kentish.</i></p>

<p>CANT OF TOGS, a gift of clothes.</p>

<p>CARDINAL, a lady’s cloak. This, I am assured, is the <i>Seven
Dials</i> cant term for a lady’s garment, but curiously enough
the same name is given to the most fashionable patterns of
the article by Regent-street drapers. A cloak with this
name was in fashion in the year 1760. It received its title
from its similarity in shape to one of the vestments of a
cardinal.</p>

<p>CARNEY, soft talk, nonsense, gammon.—<i>Hibernicism.</i></p>

<p>CAROON, five shillings. <i>French</i>, <span class="sc lower">COURONNE</span>; Gipsey, <span class="sc lower">COURNA</span>,—<span class="sc lower">PANSH

<p>CARPET, “upon the <span class="sc lower">CARPET</span>,” any subject or matter that is
uppermost for discussion or conversation. Frequently
quoted as <i>sur le tapis</i>, but it does not seem to be a correct
Parisian phrase.</p>

<p>CARRIER PIGEONS, swindlers, who formerly used to cheat
Lottery Office Keepers. <i>Nearly obsolete.</i></p>

<p>CARROTS, the coarse and satirical term for red hair.</p>

<p>CARRY-ON, to joke a person to excess, to carry on a
“spree” too far; “how we <span class="sc lower">CARRIED ON</span>, to be sure!” <i>i.e.</i>,
what fun we had.</p>

<p>CART, a race-course.</p>

<p id="carts">CARTS, a pair of shoes. In Norfolk the carapace of a crab is
called a <i>crab cart</i>, hence <span class="sc lower">CARTS</span> would be synonymous with
<span class="sc lower"><a href="#crab-shells">CRAB SHELLS</a></span>, which see.</p>

<p>CART WHEEL, a five shilling piece.</p>

<p>CASA, or <span class="sc lower">CASE</span>, a house, respectable or otherwise. Probably
from the <i>Italian</i>, <span class="sc lower">CASA</span>.—<i>Old cant.</i> The <i>Dutch</i> use the word
<span class="sc lower">KAST</span> in a vulgar sense for a house, <i>i.e.</i>, <span class="sc lower">MOTTEKAST</span>, a brothel.
<span class="sc">Case</span> sometimes means a water-closet.</p>

<p>CASCADING, vomiting.</p>

<p>CASE, a bad crown piece. <span class="sc">Half-a-case</span>, a counterfeit half
crown. There are two sources, either of which may have
contributed this slang term. <span class="sc">Caser</span> is the Hebrew word for
a crown; and silver coin is frequently counterfeited by
coating or <span class="sc lower">CASING</span> pewter or iron imitations with silver.</p>
<a id="page-112" href="#page-112" class="pagenum" title="112"></a>

<p>CASE. A few years ago the term <span class="sc lower">CASE</span> was applied to persons
and things; “what a <span class="sc lower">CASE</span> he is,” <i>i.e.</i>, what a curious
person; “a rum <span class="sc lower">CASE</span> that,” or “you are a <span class="sc lower">CASE</span>,” both
synonymous with the phrase “odd fish,” common half-a-century
ago. Among young ladies at boarding schools a
<span class="sc lower">CASE</span> means a love affair.</p>

<p>CASK, fashionable slang for a brougham, or other private
carriage.—<i>Household Words</i>, No. 183.</p>

<p>CASSAM, cheese—not <span class="sc lower">CAFFAN</span>, which Egan, in his edition of
<i>Grose</i>, has ridiculously inserted.—<i>Ancient cant.</i> <i>Latin</i>,
<span class="sc lower">CASEUS</span>.</p>

<p>CASTING UP ONE’S ACCOUNTS, vomiting.—<i>Old.</i></p>

<p>CASTOR, a hat. <span class="sc">Castor</span> was once the ancient word for a
<span class="sc lower">BEAVER</span>; and strange to add, <span class="sc lower">BEAVER</span> was the slang for
<span class="sc lower">CASTOR</span>, or hat, thirty years ago, before gossamer came
into fashion.</p>

<p>CAT, to vomit like a cat.—<i>See</i> <span class="sc lower"><a href="#shoot-the-cat">SHOOT THE CAT</a></span>.</p>

<p>CAT, a lady’s muff; “to free a <span class="sc lower">CAT</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, steal a muff.</p>

<p id="catch-em-alive">CATCH ’EM ALIVE, a trap, also a small-tooth comb.</p>

<p>CATCHY (similar formation to <i>touchy</i>), inclined to take an
undue advantage.</p>

<p>CATEVER, a queer, or singular affair; anything poor, or very
bad. From the <i>Lingua Franca</i>, and <i>Italian</i>, <span class="sc lower">CATTIVO</span>, bad.
Variously spelled by the lower orders.—<i>See</i> <span class="sc lower"><a href="#kertever">KERTEVER</a></span>.</p>

from the public, penny shows, or cheap exhibitions.</p>

<p>CAT-IN-THE-PAN, a traitor, a turn-coat—derived by some
from the <i>Greek</i>, καταπαν, altogether; or from <i>cake in
pan</i>, a pan cake, which is frequently turned from side to
side.</p>

<p>CAUCUS, a private meeting held for the purpose of concerting
measures, agreeing upon candidates for office before an

idle discourse.</p>

<p>CHALK-OUT, or <span class="sc lower">CHALK DOWN</span>, to mark out a line of conduct
or action; to make a rule, order. Phrase derived from the
<i>Workshop</i>.</p>

<p>CHALK UP, to credit, make entry in account books of indebtedness;

consideration. 7s. 6d. was the usual fee, and in three hours
the ballad might be heard in St. Paul’s Churchyard, or other
public spot. There are two men in London at the present
day who gain their living in this way.</p>
<a id="page-114" href="#page-114" class="pagenum" title="114"></a>

keeping up a showy appearance with very little means.</p>

<p>CHEAP JACKS, or <span class="sc lower">JOHNS</span>, oratorical hucksters and patterers of
hardware, &amp;c., at fairs and races. They put an article up
at a high price, and then cheapen it by degrees, indulging
in volleys of coarse wit, until it becomes to all appearance a
bargain, and as such it is bought by one of the crowd. The
popular idea is that the inverse method of auctioneering
saves them paying for the auction license.</p>

<p id="cheese">CHEESE, anything good, first-rate in quality, genuine, pleasant,
or advantageous, is termed <span class="sc lower">THE CHEESE</span>. <i>Mayhew</i> thinks
<span class="sc lower">CHEESE</span>, in this sense, is from the <i>Saxon</i>, <span class="sc lower">CEOSAN</span>, to choose,
and quotes <i>Chaucer</i>, who uses <span class="sc lower">CHESE</span> in the sense of choice.
The <i>London Guide</i>, 1818, says it was from some young
fellows translating “c’est une autre <span class="sc lower">CHOSE</span>” into “that is
another <span class="sc lower">CHEESE</span>.” <span class="sc lower">CHEESE</span> is also <i>Gipsey</i> and <i>Hindoo</i> (<i>see

the teeth and gums when laughing. Formerly the phrase
was “to grin like a <span class="sc lower">CHESHIRE CAT</span> <i>eating</i> <span class="sc lower">CHEESE</span>.” A
<i>hardly satisfactory</i> explanation has been given of this
phrase—that Cheshire is a county palatine, and the cats,
<a id="page-115" href="#page-115" class="pagenum" title="115"></a>
when they think of it, are so tickled with the notion that
they can’t help grinning.</p>

<span class="sc lower">CHAUS</span>; Massinger, <span class="sc lower">CHIAUS</span>. From the Turkish, in which
<a id="page-116" href="#page-116" class="pagenum" title="116"></a>
language it signifies an interpreter. Gifford gives a curious
story as to its origin:—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the year 1609 there was attached to the Turkish embassy in
England an interpreter, or <span class="sc lower">CHIAOUS</span>, who by cunning, aided by his
official position, managed to cheat the Turkish and Persian
merchants then in London out of the large sum of £1,000, then
deemed an enormous amount. From the notoriety which attended
the fraud, and the magnitude of the swindle, any one who
cheated or defrauded was said to <i>chiaous</i>, or <i>chause</i>, or <span class="sc lower">CHOUSE</span>;
to do, that is, as this <i>Chiaous</i> had done.—<i>See Trench, Eng. Past

<p>COCKNEY, a native of London. Originally, a spoilt or effeminate
boy, derived from <span class="sc lower">COCKERING</span>, or foolishly petting a
person, rendering them of soft or luxurious manners.
Halliwell states, in his admirable essay upon the word, that
“some writers trace the word with much probability to the
imaginary land of <span class="sc lower">COCKAYGNE</span>, the lubber land of the olden
times.” <i>Grose</i> gives Minsheu’s absurd but comical derivation:—A
citizen of London being in the country, and
hearing a horse neigh, exclaimed, “<i>Lord! how that horse
laughs</i>.” A bystander informed him that that noise was
called neighing. The next morning, when the cock crowed,
the citizen, to show that he had not forgotten what was
told him, cried out, “<i>do you hear how the</i> <span class="sc lower">COCK NEIGHS</span>?”</p>

and terrible accidents, sold in the streets as true accounts.
The man who hawks them, a patterer, often changes the
scene of the awful event to suit the taste of the neighbourhood
he is trying to delude. Possibly a corruption of <i>cook</i>,
a cooked statement, or, as a correspondent suggests, the
<span class="sc lower">COCK LANE</span> Ghost may have given rise to the term. This
had a great run, and was a rich harvest to the running
stationers.</p>

<p>COCK ROBIN SHOP, a small printer’s office, where low wages

<p>CODGER, an old man; “a rum old <span class="sc lower">CODGER</span>,” a curious old

a man.</p>

bankrupt; also the forming a balance sheet from general
trade inferences; stated by a correspondent to have been
first used in reference to the celebrated alteration of the
accounts of the Eastern Counties Railway, by George
Hudson, the Railway King.</p>

<p>COOK ONE’S GOOSE, to kill or ruin any person.—<i>North.</i></p>

<p>COOLIE, a soldier, in allusion to the <i>Hindoo</i> <span class="sc lower">COOLIES</span>, or day

<p id="coon">COON, abbreviation of Racoon.—<i>American.</i> A <span class="sc lower">GONE COON</span>—<i>ditto</i>,
one in an awful fix, past praying for. This expression is
said to have originated in the American war with a spy, who

tree. An English rifleman taking him for a veritable coon
levelled his piece at him, upon which he exclaimed, “Don’t
shoot, I’ll come down of myself, I know I’m a <span class="sc lower">GONE COON</span>.”
The Yankees say the Britisher was so flummuxed, that he

vogue some years ago, implying pugilism, high life, “sprees,”
roistering, &amp;c.—<i>Shakespere</i>. The immorality of <i>Corinth</i> was
proverbial in Greece. Κορινθίαζ εσθαι, to <i>Corinthianise</i>,
indulge in the company of courtesans, was a <i>Greek</i> slang expression.
Hence the proverb—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Οὐ παντὸς ἀνδρὸς εἰς Κόρινθον ἔσθ' ὁ πλοῦς,</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="continue">and <i>Horace</i>, Epist. lib. 1, xvii. 36—</p>

poultry, &amp;c. The London costermongers number more than
30,000. They form a distinct class, occupying whole
neighbourhoods, and are cut off from the rest of metropolitan
society by their low habits, general improvidence,
pugnacity, love of gambling, total want of education, disregard
for lawful marriage ceremonies, <i>and their use of a
cant</i> (or so-called <i>back slang</i>) <i>language</i>.</p>

<p>COSTER, the short and slang term for a costermonger, or
costard-monger, who was originally an apple seller. <span class="sc">Costering</span>,
<i>i.e.</i>, costermongering.</p>

<p>COTTON, to like, adhere to, or agree with any person; “to
cotton on to a man,” to attach yourself to him, or fancy
him, literally, to stick to him as cotton would. <i>Vide Bartlett</i>,

<span class="sc lower">COVESS</span>, was once popular, but it has fallen into disuse.
<i>Ancient cant</i>, originally (temp. Henry VIII.) <span class="sc lower">COFE</span>, or
<span class="sc lower">CUFFIN</span>, altered in <i>Decker’s</i> time to <span class="sc lower">COVE</span>. Probably connected

<p>COVENTRY, “to send a man to <span class="sc lower">COVENTRY</span>,” not to speak to or
notice him. Coventry was one of those towns in which the
privilege of practising most trades was anciently confined to
certain privileged persons, as the freemen, &amp;c. Hence a
stranger stood little chance of custom, or countenance, and
“to send a man to <span class="sc lower">COVENTRY</span>,” came to be equivalent to
putting him out of the pale of society.</p>

<p>DOG-LATIN, barbarous Latin, such as was formerly used by
lawyers in their pleadings.</p>

<p>DOG-ON-IT, a form of mild swearing used by boys. It is just
worthy of mention that <span class="sc lower">DOGONE</span>, in <i>Anglo-Norman</i>, is
equivalent to a term of contempt. <i>Friesic</i>, <span class="sc lower">DOGENIET</span>.</p>

<p>DOGSNOSE, gin and beer, so called from the mixture being

<p>DONKEY, “three more and up goes the <span class="sc lower">DONKEY</span>,” a vulgar
street phrase for extracting as much money as possible before
performing any task. The phrase had its origin with a
travelling showman, the <i>finale</i> of whose performance was
the hoisting of a <span class="sc lower">DONKEY</span> on a pole or ladder; but this consummation
was never arrived at unless the required number
of “browns” was first paid up, and “three more” was
generally the unfortunate deficit.</p>

is from the Norman, <span class="sc lower">DOSSEL</span>, a hanging, or bed canopy.</p>

<p>DOXY, the female companion of a thief or beggar. In the West
of England, the women frequently call their little girls

line of argument is adopted by a barrister, or a strange set
of questions asked, the purpose of which is not very evident.</p>

<p id="drive">DRIVE, a term used by tradesmen in speaking of business;
“he’s <span class="sc lower">DRIVING</span> a <i>roaring</i> trade,” <i>i.e.</i>, a very good one;

<i>i.e.</i>, got the best end of it.</p>
<a id="page-134" href="#page-134" class="pagenum" title="134"></a>

“shying” flat stones on the surface of a pool, which they
call <span class="sc lower">DUCKS AND DRAKES</span>, according to the number of skips
they make.</p>

<p>DUDDERS, or <span class="sc lower">DUDSMEN</span>, persons who formerly travelled the
country as pedlars, selling gown-pieces, silk waistcoats, &amp;c.,
to countrymen. In selling a waistcoat-piece for thirty
shillings or two pounds, which cost them perhaps five
shillings, they would show great fear of the revenue officer,
and beg of the purchasing clodhopper <i>to kneel down in a
puddle of water, crook his arm, and swear that it might
never become straight if he told an exciseman, or even his
own wife</i>. The term and practice are nearly obsolete. In
Liverpool, however, and at the east end of London, men

term given to pedlars. It is mentioned in the <i>Frauds of

<p>DUST, money; “down with the <span class="sc lower">DUST</span>,” put down the money.—<i>Ancient.</i>
Dean Swift once took for his text, “He who

<p>DOUBLE DUTCH, gibberish, or any foreign tongue.</p>

from the travelling menageries, where the <span class="sc lower">ELEPHANT</span> is the

<i>Bartlett</i> gives conflicting examples. <i>General</i> now, however.</p>

<p>FAN-TAIL, a dustman’s hat.</p>

<p>FAST, gay, spreeish, unsteady, thoughtless,—an Americanism
that has of late ascended from the streets to the drawing-room.
The word has certainly now a distinct meaning,
which it had not thirty years ago. <span class="sc">Quick</span> is the synonyme
for <span class="sc lower">FAST</span>, but a <span class="sc lower">QUICK MAN</span> would not convey the meaning of
a <span class="sc lower">FAST MAN</span>,—a person who by late hours, gaiety, and continual
rounds of pleasure, lives too fast and wears himself
out. In polite society a <span class="sc lower">FAST</span> young lady is one who affects
mannish habits, or makes herself conspicuous by some unfeminine
accomplishment,—talks slang, drives about in
London, smokes cigarettes, is knowing in dogs, horses, &amp;c.
An amusing anecdote is told of a <span class="sc lower">FAST</span> young lady, the
daughter of a right reverend prelate, who was an adept in
<i>horseflesh</i>. Being desirous of ascertaining the opinion of a
<a id="page-138" href="#page-138" class="pagenum" title="138"></a>
candidate for ordination, who had the look of a bird of the
same feather, as to the merits of some cattle just brought
to her father’s palace for her to select from, she was assured
by him they were utterly unfit for a lady’s use. With a
knowing look at the horses’ points, she gave her decision in
these choice words, “Well, I agree with you; they <i>are</i> a
rum lot, as the Devil said of the ten commandments.”</p>

<p>FAST, embarrassed, wanting money. Synonymous with <span class="sc lower">HARD
UP</span>.—<i>Yorkshire.</i></p>

<p>FAT, a printer’s term signifying the void spaces on a page, for
which he is paid at the same rate as full or unbroken
pages. This work afforded much <span class="sc lower">FAT</span> for the printers.</p>

<p>FAT, rich, abundant, &amp;c.; “a <span class="sc lower">FAT</span> lot;” “to cut it <span class="sc lower">FAT</span>,” to
exaggerate, to show off in an extensive or grand manner,
to assume undue importance; <!--TN: added opening quotation mark-->“cut up <span class="sc lower">FAT</span>,” see under <span class="sc lower"><a href="#cut">CUT</a></span>.
As a <i>Theatrical</i> term, a part with plenty of <span class="sc lower">FAT</span> in it, is one
which affords the actor an opportunity of effective display.</p>

<p>FATHER, or <span class="sc lower">FENCE</span>, a buyer of stolen property.</p>

<p id="fawney">FAWNEY, a finger ring.</p>

<p id="fawney-bouncing">FAWNEY BOUNCING, selling rings for a wager. This practice
is founded upon the old tale of a gentleman laying a wager
that if he was to offer “real gold sovereigns” at a penny a
piece at the foot of London Bridge, the English public would
be too incredulous to buy. The story states that the
gentleman stationed himself with sovereigns in a tea tray,
and sold only two within the hour,—winning the bet.
This tale the <span class="sc lower">FAWNEY BOUNCERS</span> tell the public, only offering
brass, double gilt rings, instead of sovereigns.</p>

<p>FAWNEY, or <span class="sc lower">FAWNEY RIG</span>, ring dropping. A few years ago,
this practice, or <span class="sc lower">RIG</span>, was very common. A fellow purposely
dropped a ring, or a pocket book with some little articles of
jewellery, &amp;c., in it, and when he saw any person pick it
up, ran to claim half. The ring found, the question of
how the booty was to be divided had then to be decided.
The <i>Fawney</i> says, “if you will give me eight or nine shillings
for my share the things are yours.” This the <span class="sc lower">FLAT</span> thinks
very fair. The ring of course is valueless, and the swallower
of the bait discovers the trick too late.</p>

<p>FEEDER, a spoon.—<i>Old cant.</i></p>

<p>FIDDLER, a sixpence.—<i>Household Words</i>, No. 183.</p>

matters, and neglects great ones.</p>

to fiddlers from each of the company in old times.</p>

<p>FIDDLING, doing any odd jobs in the streets, holding horses,
carrying parcels, &amp;c., for a living. Among the middle
classes, <span class="sc lower">FIDDLING</span> means idling away time, or trifling; and
amongst sharpers, it means gambling.</p>

<p>FID FAD, a game similar to chequers, or drafts, played in the
West of England.</p>

<p>FIDLUM BEN, thieves who take anything they can lay their
hands upon.</p>

a <i>University</i> term. Mr. <span class="sc">Cuthbert Bede</span>, however, in a communication
to <i>Notes and Queries</i>, of which I have availed
myself in the present edition, says—“If the compiler has
taken this epithet from <i>Verdant Green</i>, I can only say that
I consider the word not to be a ‘University’ word in general,
but as only due to the inventive genius of Mr. Bouncer
in particular.” The term, however, has been adopted, and
is now in general use.</p>

<a id="page-156" href="#page-156" class="pagenum" title="156"></a>

<p>HOOKS, “dropped off the <span class="sc lower">HOOKS</span>,” said of a deceased person—derived
from the ancient practice of suspending on hooks
the quarters of a traitor or felon sentenced by the old law
to be hung, drawn, and quartered, and which dropped off
the hooks as they decayed.</p>

<p>HOOKEY WALKER! ejaculation of incredulity, usually

<p id="horse-marine">HORSE MARINE, an awkward person. In ancient times the

from their ignorance of seamanship. “Tell that to the

rejoinder to a “stiff yarn.” Now-a-days they are deservedly
appreciated as the finest regiment in the service. A <span class="sc lower">HORSE

off the haunch.</p>

<p>HUMBUG, an imposition, or a person who imposes upon others.
A very expressive but slang word, synonymous at one time
with <span class="sc lower">HUM AND HAW</span>. Lexicographers have fought shy at
adopting this word. Richardson uses it frequently to express
the meaning of other words, but omits it in the alphabetical
arrangement as unworthy of recognition! In the
first edition of this work, 1785 was given as the earliest
date at which the word could be found in a printed book.
Since then I have traced <span class="sc lower">HUMBUG</span> half a century farther
back, on the title-page of a singular old jest-book—“<i>The
Universal Jester</i>; or a pocket companion for the Wits:
being a choice collection of merry conceits, facetious
drolleries, &amp;c., clenchers, closers, closures, bon-mots, and
<span class="sc lower">HUMBUGS</span>,” by <i>Ferdinando Killigrew</i>. London, about
1735–40.</p>

<p class="continue indent">I have also ascertained that the famous Orator Henley was
known to the mob as <span class="sc">Orator Humbug</span>. The fact may be
learnt from an illustration in that exceedingly curious little
collection of <i>Caricatures</i>, published in 1757, many of which
were sketched by Lord Bolingbroke—Horace Walpole filling
in the names and explanations. <i>Halliwell</i> describes <span class="sc lower">HUMBUG</span>
as “a person who hums,” and cites Dean Milles’ MS., which
was written about 1760. It has been stated that the word
is a corruption of Hamburgh, from which town so many
false bulletins and reports came during the war in the last
century. “Oh, that is <i>Hamburgh</i> [or <span class="sc lower">HUMBUG</span>],” was the
answer to any fresh piece of news which smacked of improbability.
<a id="page-158" href="#page-158" class="pagenum" title="158"></a>
<i>Grose</i> mentions it in his Dictionary, 1785; and
in a little printed squib, published in 1808, entitled <i>Bath
Characters</i>, by <i>T. Goosequill</i>, <span class="sc lower">HUMBUG</span> is thus mentioned in a
comical couplet on the title page:—</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="line">“Wee Thre Bath Deities bee,</div>
  <div class="line"><span class="sc">Humbug</span>, Follie, and Varietee.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="continue">Gradually from this time the word began to assume a place
in periodical literature, and in novels not written by
squeamish or over-precise authors. In the preface to a flat,
and, I fear, unprofitable poem, entitled, <i>The Reign of</i> <span class="sc lower">HUMBUG</span>,
<i>a Satire</i>, 8vo., 1836, the author thus apologises for the use
of the word—“I have used the term <span class="sc lower">HUMBUG</span> to designate
this principle [wretched sophistry of life generally], considering
that it is now adopted into our language as much as
the words <i>dunce</i>, <i>jockey</i>, <i>cheat</i>, <i>swindler</i>, &amp;c., which were
formerly only colloquial terms.” A correspondent, who in
a late number of <i>Adersaria</i> ingeniously traced <i>bombast</i> to
the inflated Doctor Paracelsus Bombast, considers that
<span class="sc lower">HUMBUG</span> may, in like manner, be derived from <i>Homberg</i>, the
distinguished chemist of the court of the Duke of Orleans,
who, according to the following passage from Bishop
Berkeley’s “Siris,” was an ardent and successful seeker
after the philosopher’s stone!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“§ 194.—Of this there cannot be a better proof than the experiment
of Monsieur Homberg, <span class="sc lower">WHO MADE GOLD OF MERCURY BY INTRODUCING
LIGHT INTO ITS PORES</span>, but at such trouble and expense,
that, I suppose, nobody will try the experiment for profit.
By this injunction of light and mercury, both bodies became
fixed, and produced a third different to either, to wit, real gold.
For the truth of which <span class="sc lower">FACT</span> I refer to the memoirs of the
French Academy of Sciences.”—<i>Berkeley’s Works</i>, vol. ii., p. 366,
(Wright’s edition).</p>

<p class="continue">The universal use of this term is remarkable; in California
there is a town called <i>Humbug Flat</i>—a name which gives a
significant hint of the acuteness of the first settler.</p>

<p>HUM-DRUM, tedious, tiresome, boring; “a society of gentlemen
who used to meet near the Charter House, or at
the King’s Head, St. John’s street. They were characterised

<p>HURDY-GURDY, a droning musical instrument shaped like a
large fiddle, and turned by a crank, used by Savoyards and
itinerant foreign musicians in England, now nearly superseded
by the hand-organ. A correspondent suggests that
the name is derived from being <i>girded</i> on the <span class="sc lower">HARDIES</span>, loins
or buttocks.—<i>Scotch</i>; <i>Tam o’Shanter</i>. In <i>Italy</i> the instrument
is called <span class="sc lower">VIOLA</span>.</p>

a corruption of the <i>Italian</i>, <span class="sc lower">GIOJE</span>; <i>French</i>, <span class="sc lower">JOUAILLE</span>, a jewel.
In ancient times, when a king was short of cash, he
generally issued orders for so many <i>Jew’s eyes</i>, or equivalent
sums of money. The Jews preferred paying the
ransom, although often very heavy. We thus realise the
popularly believed origin of <span class="sc lower">JEW’S EYE.</span> Used by <i>Shakespere</i>.</p>

<p>JEW-FENCER, a Jew street salesman.</p>

<p>JIB, the face, or a person’s expression; “the cut of his <span class="sc lower">JIB</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>

<p>JOB, a short piece of work, a prospect of employment. <i>Johnson</i>
describes <span class="sc lower">JOB</span> as a low word, without etymology. It is, and
was, however, a cant word, and a <span class="sc lower">JOB</span>, two centuries ago,
was an arranged robbery. Even at the present day it is

obtained by secret influence or favouritism.</p>

<p>To JOE BLAKE THE BARTLEMY, to visit a low woman.</p>

<p>JOEY, a fourpenny piece. The term is derived (like <span class="sc lower">BOBBY</span> from
<a id="page-162" href="#page-162" class="pagenum" title="162"></a>
Sir Robert Peel) from Joseph Hume, the late respected
M.P. The explanation is thus given in <i>Hawkins’ History of
the Silver Coinage of England</i>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“These pieces are said to have owed their existence to the pressing
instance of Mr. Hume, from whence they, for some time, bore
the nickname of <span class="sc lower">JOEYS</span>. As they were very convenient to pay
short cab fares, the Hon. M.P. was extremely unpopular with
the drivers, who frequently received only a <i>groat</i> where otherwise
they would have received a sixpence without any demand for
change.” The term originated with the London cabmen, who
have invented many others.</p>

his stall may think it a good opportunity to lay out their
money. “Chuck a <span class="sc lower">JOLLY</span>,” literally translated, is to throw

<p>KICK THE BUCKET, to die.—<i>Norfolk.</i> According to Forby,
a metaphor taken from the descent of a well or mine, which
is of course absurd. The Rev. E.&nbsp;S. Taylor supplies me
with the following note from his MS. additions to the work
of the East-Anglian lexicographer:—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The allusion is to the way in which a slaughtered pig is hung up,
viz., by passing the ends of a bent piece of wood behind the
tendons of the hind legs, and so suspending it to a hook in a
beam above. This piece of wood is locally termed <i>a bucket</i>, and
so by a coarse metaphor the phrase came to signify to die.
Compare the Norfolk phrase “as wrong as a bucket.”</p>

<p>KIDMENT, a pocket-handkerchief fastened to the pocket, and
partially hung out to entrap thieves.</p>

<p>KIDNAPPER, one who steals children or adults. From <span class="sc lower">KID</span>, a
child, and <span class="sc lower">NAB</span> (corrupted to <span class="sc lower">NAP</span>), to steal, or seize.</p>

<p>KIDNEY, “of that <span class="sc lower">KIDNEY</span>,” of such a stamp: “strange
<span class="sc lower">KIDNEY</span>,” odd humour; “two of a <span class="sc lower">KIDNEY</span>,” two persons
of a sort, or as like as two peas, <i>i.e.</i>, resembling each other
like two kidneys in a bunch.—<i>Old.</i> “Attempt to put their
hair out of <span class="sc lower">KIDNEY</span>.”—<i>Terræ Filius</i>, 1763.</p>

<p>KIDSMAN, one who trains boys to thieve and pick pockets successfully.</p>

<p>KILKENNY CAT, a popular simile for a voracious or desperate
animal or person, from the story of the two cats in that
county, who are said to have fought and bitten each other
until a small portion of the tail of one of them alone
remained.</p>

<p>KILLING, bewitching, fascinating. The term is akin to the
phrase “dressing to <span class="sc lower">DEATH</span>.”</p>

<p>KIMBO, or <span class="sc lower">A-KIMBO</span><!--TN: was "A KIMBO"-->, holding the arms in a bent position from
the body, and resting the hands upon the hips, in a bullying
attitude. Said to be from <span class="sc lower">A SCHEMBO</span>, <i>Italian</i>; but more
probably from <span class="sc lower">KIMBAW</span>, the old cant for beating, or bullying.—<i>See
Grose.</i></p>

<p>KINCHIN, a child.—<i>Old cant.</i> From the <i>German</i> diminutive,
<span class="sc lower">KINDCHEN</span>, a baby.</p>

<p>KINCHIN COVE, a man who robs children; a little man.—<i>Ancient
cant.</i></p>

<p>KINGSMAN, the favourite coloured neckerchief of the costermongers.
The women wear them thrown over their
shoulders. With both sexes they are more valued than any
other article of clothing. A coster’s <i>caste</i>, or position, is at
stake, he imagines, if his <span class="sc lower">KINGSMAN</span> is not of the most
approved pattern. When he fights, his <span class="sc lower">KINGSMAN</span> is tied
<a id="page-165" href="#page-165" class="pagenum" title="165"></a>
either around his waist as a belt, or as a garter around his
leg. This very singular partiality for a peculiar coloured
neckcloth was doubtless derived from the Gipseys, and
probably refers to an Oriental taste or custom long forgotten
by these vagabonds. A singular similarity of taste for
certain colours exists amongst the Hindoos, Gipseys, and
London costermongers. Red and yellow (or orange) are the
great favourites, and in these hues the Hindoo selects his
turban and his robe; the Gipsey his breeches, and his wife
her shawl or gown; and the costermonger his plush waistcoat
and favourite <span class="sc lower">KINGSMAN</span>. Amongst either class, when
a fight takes place, the greatest regard is paid to the
favourite coloured article of dress. The Hindoo lays aside
his turban, the Gipsey folds up his scarlet breeches or coat,
whilst the pugilistic costermonger of Covent Garden or
Billingsgate, as we have just seen, removes his favourite
neckerchief to a part of his body, by the rules of the “ring,”
comparatively out of danger. Amongst the various patterns
of kerchiefs worn by the wandering tribes of London, red
and yellow are the oldest and most in fashion. Blue, intermixed
with spots, is a late importation, probably from the
Navy, through sporting characters.</p>

<p>KING’S PICTURES (now, of course, <span class="sc lower">QUEEN’S PICTURES</span>), money.</p>

<p>KISKY, drunk, fuddled.</p>

<p>KISS-ME-QUICK, the name given to the very small bonnets
worn by females since 1850.</p>

<p>KNAPPING-JIGGER, a turnpike-gate; “to dub at the <span class="sc lower">KNAPPING-JIGGER</span>,”
to pay money at the turnpike.</p>

<p>KNARK, a hard-hearted or savage person.</p>

<p>KNIFE, “to <span class="sc lower">KNIFE</span> a person,” to stab, an un-English but now-a-days
a very common expression.</p>

<p>KNIFE-BOARD, the seat running along the roof of an omnibus.</p>

<p>KNIGHT, a common and ironical prefix to a man’s calling,—thus,
“<span class="sc lower">KNIGHT</span> of the whip,” a coachman; “<span class="sc lower">KNIGHT</span> of
the thimble,” a tailor.</p>

<p>KNOCK ABOUT THE BUB, to hand or pass about the drink.</p>
<a id="page-166" href="#page-166" class="pagenum" title="166"></a>

<p>KNOCK DOWN, or <span class="sc lower">KNOCK ME DOWN</span>, strong ale.</p>

<p>KNOCK OFF, to give over, or abandon. A saying used by
workmen about dinner, or other meal times, for upwards of
two centuries.</p>

<p>KNOCKED UP, tired, jaded, used up, done for. In the United
States, amongst females, the phrase is equivalent to being
<i>enceinte</i>, so that Englishmen often unconsciously commit
themselves when amongst our Yankee cousins.</p>

<p>KNOCK-IN, the game of <i>loo</i>.</p>

<p id="knock-outs">KNOCK-OUTS, or <span class="sc lower">KNOCK-INS</span>, disreputable persons who visit
auction rooms and unite to buy the articles at their own
prices. One of their number is instructed to buy for the
rest, and after a few small bids as blinds to the auctioneer
and bystanders, the lot is knocked down to the <span class="sc lower">KNOCK-OUT</span>
bidders, at a nominal price—the competition to result from
an auction being thus frustrated and set aside. At the conclusion
of the sale the goods are paid for, and carried to
some neighbouring public house, where they are re-sold or
<span class="sc lower">KNOCKED-OUT</span>, and the difference between the first purchase
and the second—or tap-room <span class="sc lower">KNOCK-OUT</span>—is divided
amongst the gang. As generally happens with ill-gotten
gains, the money soon finds its way to the landlord’s pocket,
and the <span class="sc lower">KNOCK-OUT</span> is rewarded with a red nose or a bloated
face. Cunning tradesmen join the <span class="sc lower">KNOCK-OUTS</span> when an
opportunity for money making presents itself. The lowest
description of <span class="sc lower">KNOCK-OUTS</span>, fellows with more tongue than
capital, are termed <span class="sc lower"><a href="#babes">BABES</a></span>,—which see.</p>

<p>KNOCKING-SHOP, a brothel, or disreputable house frequented
by prostitutes.</p>

<p>KNOWING, a slang term for sharpness; “<span class="sc lower">KNOWING</span> codger,” or
“a <span class="sc lower">KNOWING</span> blade,” one who can take you in, or cheat you,
in any transaction you may have with him. It implies also
deep cunning and foresight, and generally signifies dishonesty.</p>

<p>LADDLE, a lady. Term with chimney-sweeps on the 1st of

having once been used in the presence of an officer of
marines, he was at first inclined to take it as an insult,
until some one adroitly appeased his wrath by remarking

imply was, “one who had done his duty, and was ready to
do it again.”—<i>See</i> <span class="sc lower"><a href="#horse-marine">HORSE MARINE</a></span>.—<i>Naval.</i></p>

in the streets.—<i>Old cant.</i> <span class="sc">Maung</span>, to beg, is a term in use

<p id="medical-greek">MEDICAL GREEK, the slang used by medical students at the
hospitals. At the London University they have a way of

<i>Hindoo</i>. <i>Shakespere</i> has <span class="sc lower">MOE</span>, to make mouths.</p>

each other as independent authorities, being all the while
the production of the same editorial staff.</p>

<p>MUNGARLY CASA, a baker’s shop; evidently a corruption of
some <i>Lingua Franca</i> phrase for an eating house. The well

<p>PALL, to detect.</p>

<p>PALM OIL, or PALM SOAP, money.</p>

<p>PALMING, robbing shops by pairs,—one thief bargaining with
apparent intent to purchase, whilst the other watches his
opportunity to steal. An amusing example of <span class="sc lower">PALMING</span>
came off some time since. A man entered a “ready made”
boot and shoe shop and desired to be shown a pair of boots,—his
companion staying outside and amusing himself by
looking in at the window. The one who required to be
fresh shod was apparently of a humble and deferential turn,
for he placed his hat on the floor directly he stepped in the
shop. Boot after boot was tried on until at last a fit was
obtained,—when lo, forth came a man, snatched up the
customer’s hat left near the door, and down the street he
ran as fast as his legs could carry him. Away went the
<a id="page-186" href="#page-186" class="pagenum" title="186"></a>
customer after his hat, and Crispin, standing at the door,
clapped his hands and shouted “go it, you’ll catch him,”—little
thinking that it was a concerted trick, and that
neither his boots nor the customer would ever return.

<p id="pantile">PANTILE, a hat. The term <span class="sc lower">PANTILE</span> is properly applied to the
mould into which the sugar is poured which is afterwards
known as “loaf sugar.” Thus, <span class="sc lower">PANTILE</span>, from whence comes
the phrase “a sugar-loaf hat,” originally signified a tall,
conical hat, in shape similar to that usually represented as
the head gear of a bandit. From <span class="sc lower">PANTILE</span>, the more
modern slang term <span class="sc lower">TILE</span> has been derived. <i>Halliwell</i> gives
<span class="sc lower">PANTILE SHOP</span>, a meeting-house.</p>

<p>PANTILER, a dissenting preacher. Probably from the practice
of the Quakers, and many dissenters, of not removing the
hat in a place of worship.</p>

<p>PATTER, a speech or discourse, a pompous street oration, a
judge’s summing up, a trial. <i>Ancient</i> word for muttering.
Probably from the <i>Latin</i>, <span class="sc lower">PATER NOSTER</span>, or Lord’s Prayer.
This was said, before the Reformation, in a <i>low voice</i> by the
priest, until he came to, “and lead us not into temptation,”
to which the choir responded, “but deliver us
from evil.” In our reformed Prayer Book this was altered,
and the Lord’s Prayer directed to be said “with a <i>loud
voice</i>.”—<i>Dr. Pusey</i> takes this view of the derivation in his
<i>Letter to the Bishop of London</i>, p. 78, 1851. <i>Scott</i> uses the
word twice in <i>Ivanhoe</i> and the <i>Bride of Lammermoor</i>.</p>

<p>PATTER, to talk. <span class="sc">Patter flash</span>, to speak the language of
thieves, talk cant.</p>

<p id="patterers">PATTERERS, men who cry last dying speeches, &amp;c., in the
streets, and those who help off their wares by <i>long
harangues</i> in the public thoroughfares. These men, to use
their own term “are the haristocracy of the street sellers,”
and despise the costermongers for their ignorance, boasting
that they live by their intellect. The public, they say, do not
expect to receive from them an equivalent for their money—they
pay to hear them talk.—<i>Mayhew.</i> <span class="sc">Patterers</span> were
formerly termed “mountebanks.”</p>

<p>PAWS, hands.</p>

<p>PAY, to beat a person, or “serve them out.” Originally a

pitch (<i>French</i>, <span class="sc lower">POIX</span>); “here’s the d——l to <span class="sc lower">PAY</span>, and no
pitch hot,” said when any catastrophe occurs which there is
no means of averting; “to <span class="sc lower">PAY</span> over face and eyes, as the
cat did the monkey;” “to <span class="sc lower">PAY</span> through the nose,” to give
a ridiculous price.—whence the origin? <i>Shakespere</i> uses
<span class="sc lower">PAY</span> in the sense of to beat, or thrash.</p>

<p>PEACH, to inform against or betray. <i>Webster</i> states that <i>impeach</i>
is now the modification mostly used, and that <span class="sc lower">PEACH</span>
is confined principally to the conversation of thieves and the
lower orders.</p>

<p>PEACOCK HORSE, amongst undertakers, is one with a showy
tail and mane, and holds its head up well,—<i>che va favorreggiando</i>,

<p>PLANT, a dodge, a preconcerted swindle; a position in the

a coster will join a party of gambling costers that

his mate will come up and commence betting

<p>POLL, the “ordinary degree” candidates for the B.A. Examination,

Mr. Hopkins being the most celebrated “honour
coach,” or private tutor for the wranglers, and Mr. Potts
the principal “crammer” of the non-honour men, the latter
was facetiously termed the “<span class="sc lower">POLLY HOPKINS</span>” by the undergraduates.</p>

<p>POSH, a halfpenny, or trifling coin. Also a generic term for
money.</p>

<p>POSTERIORS, a correspondent insists that the vulgar sense of
this word is undoubtedly slang (Swift, I believe, first

A half crown, in medical student slang, is a <span class="sc lower">FIVE-POT
PIECE</span>.</p>

<p>POT, “to <span class="sc lower">GO TO POT</span>,” to die; from the classic custom of
putting the ashes of the dead in an urn; also, to be ruined, or
broken up,—often applied to tradesmen who fail in business.
<span class="sc">Go to pot!</span> <i>i.e.</i>, go and hang yourself, shut up and be quiet.

<p>POT-HUNTER, a sportsman who shoots anything he comes

<p>POT-LUCK, just as it comes; to take <span class="sc lower">POT-LUCK</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, one’s chance
of a dinner,—a hearty term used to signify whatever the
pot contains you are welcome to.</p>

<p id="pot-walloper">POT-WALLOPERS, electors in certain boroughs before the
passing of the Reform Bill, whose qualification consisted in
being housekeepers,—to establish which, it was only necessary
to boil a pot within the limits of the borough, by the

were able to provide for themselves, and not necessitated to
apply for parochial relief. <span class="sc">Wallop</span>, a word of <i>Anglo Saxon</i>

<p id="prick-the-garter">PRICK THE GARTER, or <span class="sc lower">PITCH THE NOB</span>, a gambling and cheating
<a id="page-194" href="#page-194" class="pagenum" title="194"></a>
game common at fairs, and generally practised by
thimble riggers. It consists of a “garter” or a piece of list
doubled, and then folded up tight. The bet is made upon
your asserting that you can, with a pin, “prick” the point
at which the garter is doubled. The garter is then unfolded,
and nine times out of ten you will find that you have
been deceived, and that you pricked one of the false folds.
The owner of the garter, I should state, holds the ends
tightly with one hand. This was, doubtless, originally a
Gipsey game, and we are informed by <i>Brand</i> that it was
much practised by the Gipseys in the time of <i>Shakespere</i>.
In those days, it was termed <span class="sc lower">PRICKING AT THE BELT</span>, or <span class="sc lower">FAST

<p>PRIG, a thief.<!--TN: added period--> Used by <i>Addison</i> in the sense of a coxcomb.
<i>Ancient cant</i>, probably from the <i>Saxon</i>, <span class="sc lower">PRICC-AN</span>, to filch, &amp;c.—<i>Shakespere.</i>
<span class="sc">Prig</span>, to steal, or rob. <span class="sc">Prigging</span>, thieving.
In <i>Scotland</i> the term <span class="sc lower">PRIG</span> is used in a different sense from
what it is in England. In Glasgow, or at Aberdeen, “to
<span class="sc lower">PRIG</span> a salmon,” would be to cheapen it, or seek for an
abatement in the price. A story is told of two Scotchmen,
visitors to London, who got into sad trouble a few years
ago by announcing their intention of “<span class="sc lower">PRIGGING</span> a hat”
which they had espied in a fashionable manufacturer’s
window, and which one of them thought he would like to
possess.</p>

<p>QUEER, an old cant word, once in continual use as a prefix, signifying
base, roguish, or worthless,—the opposite of <span class="sc lower">RUM</span>,
which signified good and genuine. <span class="sc">Queer</span>, in all probability,
is immediately derived from the cant language. It has been
mooted that it came into use from a <i>quære</i> (?) being set before
a man’s name; but it is more than probable that it was
brought into this country by the Gipseys from Germany,
where QUER signifies “<i>cross</i>,” or “<i>crooked</i>.” At all events,
it is believed to have been first used in England as a cant
word.</p>

for another. The word is used by <i>Old French</i> writers:—</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="line">“Des testamens qu’on dit le maistre</div>
  <div class="line">De mon fait n’aura <span class="sc lower">QUID</span> ne <span class="sc lower">QUOD</span>.”</div>

<p>QUID, a small piece of tobacco—one mouthful. <i>Quid est hoc?</i>

expression used by Mr. Hughes, in <i>Tom Brown’s Schooldays</i>

upon the origin of this now very common street term:—“Flogged
or whipped in <span class="sc lower">QUAD</span>,” says the delineator of
student life, in allusion to chastisement inflicted within the
<i>Quadrangle</i> of a college. Quadrangle is the term given to
the prison inclosure within which culprits are allowed to
walk, and where whippings were formerly inflicted. Quadrangle
also represents a building of four sides; and to be

<i>Sub rosâ</i>), <i>i.e.</i>, under the obligation of silence and secresy,
of which the rose was anciently an emblem, perhaps, as
Sir Thomas Browne remarks, from the closeness with which
its petals are enfolded in the bud. The Rose of Venus was
given, says the classic legend, to Harpocrates, the God of
Silence, by Cupid, as a bribe not to “peach” about the
Goddess’ amours. It was commonly sculptured on the
ceilings of banquetting rooms, as a sign that what was said
in free conversation there was not afterwards to be divulged
and about 1526 was placed over the Roman confessionals as
an emblem of secrecy. The White Rose was also an
emblem of the Pretender, whose health, as king, his secret

capable of seating six or eight boys and girls, erected in a
high frame, and turned round by men at a windlass. Fairs
and merry-makings generally abound with them. The
frames take to pieces, and are carried in vans by miserable

<p>RUM, like its opposite, <span class="sc lower">QUEER</span>, was formerly a much used prefix,
signifying, fine, good, gallant, or valuable, perhaps in some
way connected with <span class="sc lower">ROME</span>. Now-a-days it means indifferent,
bad, or questionable, and we often hear even persons in
polite society use such a phrase as “what a <span class="sc lower">RUM</span> fellow he
is, to be sure,” in speaking of a man of singular habits or
appearance. The term, from its frequent use, long since
claimed a place in our dictionaries; but, with the exception

<p class="continue indent">⁂ This curious list of numerals in use among the London
street folk is, strange as it may seem, derived from the
<i>Lingua Franca</i>, or bastard <i>Italian</i>, of the Mediterranean
seaports, of which other examples may be found in the pages
of this Dictionary. <span class="sc">Saltee</span>, the cant term used by the
costermongers and others for a penny, is no other than the
<i>Italian</i>, <span class="sc lower">SOLDO</span> (plural, <span class="sc lower">SOLDI</span>), and the numerals—as may be
seen by the <i>Italian</i> equivalents—are a tolerably close imitation
of the originals. After the number <span class="sc lower">SIX</span>, a curious variation
occurs, which is peculiar to the London cant, seven
being reckoned as <span class="sc lower">SAY ONEY</span>, <i>six-one</i>, <span class="sc lower">SAY DOOE</span>, <i>six-two</i> = 8,
and so on. <span class="sc">Dacha</span>, I may remark, is perhaps from the
<i>Greek</i>, <span class="sc lower">DEKA</span> (δέκα), ten, which, in the Constantinopolitan
<i>Lingua Franca</i>, is likely enough to have been substituted
for the <i>Italian</i>. <span class="sc">Madza</span>, is clearly the <i>Italian</i> <span class="sc lower">MEZZA</span>. The
origin of <span class="sc lower">BEONG</span> I have not been so fortunate as to discover,
unless it be the <i>French</i>, <span class="sc lower">BIEN</span>, the application of which to a
shilling is not so evident; but amongst costermongers and
other street folk, it is quite immaterial what foreign tongue
contributes to their secret language. Providing the terms
are unknown to the police and the public generally, they
care not a rushlight whether the polite French, the gay
Spaniards, or the cloudy Germans helped to swell their
vocabulary. The numbers of low foreigners, however,
dragging out a miserable existence in our crowded neighbourhoods,
organ grinders and image sellers, foreign seamen
from the vessels in the river, and our own connection with
Malta and the Ionian Isles, may explain, to a certain extent,
the phenomenon of these Southern phrases in the mouths
of costers and tramps.</p>

<p>SALVE, praise, flattery, chaff.</p>

<p>SAM, to “stand <span class="sc lower">SAM</span>,” to pay for refreshment, or drink, to stand

which letters were jocularly said to be the initials of
<i>Uncle Sam</i> (the Government), who pays for all. In use in
this country as early as 1827.</p>

<p>SAVEY, to know; “do you <span class="sc lower">SAVEY</span> that?”—<i>French</i>, <span class="sc lower">SAVEZ VOUS
CELA</span>? In the nigger and <i>Anglo Chinese patois</i>, this is <span class="sc lower">SABBY</span>,
“me no <span class="sc lower">SABBY</span>.” The Whampoa slang of this description is
very extraordinary; from it we have got our word <span class="sc lower">CASH</span>!</p>

<p>SAW YOUR TIMBER, “be off!” equivalent to <i>cut your stick</i>.—<i>See</i>
<span class="sc lower"><a href="#cut">CUT</a></span>.</p>

plundering and thieving. A <span class="sc lower">ROYAL-SCAMP</span> was a highwayman,

but his legs to trust to in case of an attempt at capture.
Some have derived <span class="sc lower">SCAMP</span> from <i>qui ex campo exit</i>, viz., one
who leaves the field, a deserter.</p>

<p>SCARPER, to run away.—<i>Spanish</i>, <span class="sc lower">ESCAPAR</span>, to escape, make off;
<i>Italian</i>, <span class="sc lower">SCAPPARE</span>. “<span class="sc">Scarper</span> with the feele of the donna
of the cassey,” to run away with the daughter of the land-lady

figlia della donna della casa</i>.”</p>

<p>SCOT, a quantity of anything, a lot, a share.—<i>Anglo Saxon</i>,
<span class="sc lower">SCEAT</span>, pronounced <span class="sc lower">SHOT</span>.</p>

<p>SCOT, temper, or passion,—from the irascible temperament of
that nation; “oh! what a <span class="sc lower">SCOT</span> he was in,” <i>i.e.</i>, what temper
he showed,—especially if you allude to the following.</p>

<p>SCOTCH FIDDLE, the itch; “to play the <span class="sc lower">SCOTCH FIDDLE</span>,” to
work the index finger of the right hand like a fiddlestick
between the index and middle finger of the left. This provokes
a Scotchmen in the highest degree, it implying that
he is afflicted with the itch.</p>

<p>SCOTCH GRAYS, lice. Our northern neighbours are calumniously
reported, from their living on oatmeal, to be

at a public-house. <span class="sc">Scranning</span>, begging for broken

<p>SCRATCH, a fight, contest, point in dispute; “coming up to

made in reference to him (with one exception) are void.—<i>See</i>
P.P.—<i>Turf.</i></p>

<p>SCRATCH-RACE (on the <i>Turf</i>), a race where any horse, aged,
winner, or loser, can run with any weights; in fact, a race
without restrictions. At <i>Cambridge</i> a boat-race, where the
crews are drawn by lot.</p>

<p>SCREAMING, first-rate, splendid. Believed to have been first
used in the <i>Adelphi</i> play-bills; “a <span class="sc lower">SCREAMING</span> farce,” one

specimens of elaborate writing, thunderstorms, ships on fire,

art, are not always the draughtsmen. The artist, or
<span class="sc lower">SCREEVER</span>, drew, perhaps, in half-a-dozen places that very
morning, and rented the spots out to as many cadaverous
looking men.</p>

man’s coat begins to look worn out and shabby he is said
to look <span class="sc lower">SEEDY</span> and ready for <i>cutting</i>. This term has been
“on the streets” for nearly two centuries, and latterly has
found its way into most dictionaries. Formerly slang, it is
now a recognised word, and one of the most expressive in
the English language. The French are always amused with
it, they having no similar term.</p>

<p>SELL, to deceive, swindle, or play a practical joke upon a person.
A sham is a <span class="sc lower">SELL</span> in street parlance. “<span class="sc">Sold</span> again, and got

<p>SHOP BOUNCER, or <span class="sc lower">SHOP LIFTER</span>, a person generally respectably

<p>SHOPPING, purchasing at shops. Termed by <i>Todd</i> a slang
word, but used by <i>Cowper</i> and <i>Byron</i>.</p>

<p>SHORT, when spirit is drunk without any admixture of water,
it is said to be taken “short;” “summat <span class="sc lower">SHORT</span>,” a dram. A
similar phrase is used at the counters of banks; upon presenting
a cheque, the clerk asks, “how will you take it?”
<i>i.e.</i>, in gold, or in notes? Should it be desired to receive it
in as small a compass as possible, the answer is, “<span class="sc lower">SHORT</span>.”</p>

<p>SHORT COMMONS, short allowance of food.—<i>See</i> <span class="sc lower"><a href="#commons">COMMONS</a></span>.</p>

<p>SHOT, from the modern sense of the word to <span class="sc lower">SHOOT</span>,—a guess,
a random conjecture; “to make a bad <span class="sc lower">SHOT</span>,” to expose one’s
ignorance by making a wrong guess, or random answer
without knowing whether it is right or wrong.</p>

<p>SHOT, from the once <i>English</i>, but now provincial word, to
<span class="sc lower">SHOOT</span>, to subscribe, contribute in fair proportion;—a
share, the same as <span class="sc lower">SCOT</span>, both being from the <i>Anglo
Saxon</i> word, <span class="sc lower">SCEAT</span>; “to pay one’s <span class="sc lower">SHOT</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, share of the

word is from the <i>Danish</i>, <span class="sc lower">SKUFFE</span>, to shove, to deceive, cheat;
<i>Saxon</i>, <span class="sc lower">SCUFAN</span>,—whence the <i>English</i>, <span class="sc lower">SHOVE</span>. The term,
however, is possibly one of the many street words from the
<i>Hebrew</i> (through the low Jews); <span class="sc lower">SHEPHEL</span>, in that language,
<a id="page-214" href="#page-214" class="pagenum" title="214"></a>
signifying a <i>low</i> or debased estate. <i>Chaldee</i>, <span class="sc lower">SHAPHAL</span>.—<i>See</i>
Psalm cxxxvi. 23, “in our <i>low estate</i>.” A correspondent
suggests another very probable derivation, from the <i>German</i>,
<span class="sc lower">SCHOFEL</span>, trash, rubbish,—the <i>German</i> adjective, <span class="sc lower">SCHOFELIG</span>,
being the nearest possible translation of our <i>shabby</i>.</p>

<p>SHY, to fling; <span class="sc lower">COCK-SHY</span>, a game at fairs, consisting of throwing

Those who have witnessed Mr. C. Mathews’ performance in
Mrs. Centlivre’s admirable comedy of <i>A Bold Stroke for a
Wife</i>, and the laughable coolness with which he, the <i>false</i>
<span class="sc lower">SIMON PURE</span>, assuming the quaker dress and character of
the <span class="sc lower">REAL ONE</span>, elbowed that worthy out of his expected

<p>SIR HARRY, a close stool.</p>

<p>SISERARA, a hard blow.—<i>Suffolk.</i> Moor derives it from the

a corruption of <span class="sc lower">CERTIORARI</span>, a Chancery writ reciting

<p>SIXES AND SEVENS, articles in confusion are said to be all
<span class="sc lower">SIXES</span> and <span class="sc lower">SEVENS</span>. The Deity is mentioned in the Towneley
Mysteries as He that “sett all on seven,” <i>i.e.</i>, set or
appointed everything in seven days. A similar phrase at
this early date implied confusion and disorder, and from
these, <i>Halliwell</i> thinks, has been derived the phrase “to be
at <span class="sc lower">SIXES AND SEVENS</span>.” A Scotch correspondent, however,
states that the phrase probably came from the workshop,
and that amongst needle makers when the points and eyes
are “heads and tails” (“heeds and thraws”), or in confusion,
they are said to be <span class="sc lower">SIXES AND SEVENS</span>, because those
numbers are the sizes most generally used, and in the course
of manufacture have frequently to be distinguished.</p>

<p id="size">SIZE, to order extras over and above the usual commons at the

paid for at a certain specified rate <i>per</i> <span class="sc lower">SIZE</span>, or portion, to
the college cook.—<i>Peculiar to Cambridge.</i> <i>Minsheu</i> says,
“<span class="sc lower">SIZE</span>, a farthing which schollers in Cambridge have at the
buttery, noted with the letter <i>s</i>.”</p>

<p>SIZERS, or <span class="sc lower">SIZARS</span>, are certain poor scholars at Cambridge, annually
elected, who get their dinners (including <i>sizings</i>) from
what is left at the upper, or Fellows’ table, free, or nearly
so. They pay rent of rooms, and some other fees, on a
lower scale than the “Pensioners” or ordinary students,
and answer to the “battlers” and “servitors” at Oxford.</p>

<p>SKITTLES, a game similar to Ten Pins, which, when interdicted
by the Government was altered to Nine Pins, or
<span class="sc lower">SKITTLES</span>. They are set up in an alley and are <i>thrown at</i>

a small flat cheese. The costers consider themselves the
best players in London.</p>

only to be found in the Dictionaries of <i>Webster</i> and <i>Ogilvie</i>.
It was, perhaps, first recorded by <i>Grose</i>, in his <i>Dictionary
of the Vulgar Tongue</i>, 1785. <span class="sc">Slang</span>, since it has been
adopted as an English word, generally implies vulgar language
not known or recognised as <span class="sc lower">CANT</span>; and latterly,
when applied to speech, has superseded the word <span class="sc lower">FLASH</span>.</p>

<p>SLANG, counterfeit or short weights and measures. A <span class="sc lower">SLANG</span>
quart is a pint and a half. <span class="sc">Slang</span> measures are lent out at

<p>SLAVEY, a maid servant.</p>

<p>SLEWED, drunk, or intoxicated.—<i>Sea term.</i> When a vessel
changes the tack she, as it were, staggers, the sails flap, she
gradually heels over, and the wind catching the waiting
canvas, she glides off at another angle. The course pursued
by an intoxicated, or <span class="sc lower">SLEWED</span> man, is supposed to be analogous<!--TN: was "analagous"-->
to that of the ship.</p>

<p>SLICK, an <i>Americanism</i>, very prevalent in England since the
publication of Judge Haliburton’s facetious stories. As an

<i>verb</i>, it has the force of “to despatch rapidly,” turn off, get
done with a thing.</p>

<p>SLING, to pass from one person to another.</p>

<p id="slip">SLIP, “to give the <span class="sc lower">SLIP</span>,” to run away, or elude pursuit. <i>Shakespere</i>

<p>SLOG, or <span class="sc lower">SLOGGER</span> (its original form), to beat, baste, or wallop.
<i>German</i>, <span class="sc lower">SCHLAGEN</span>; or, perhaps a vulgar corruption of
<span class="sc lower">SLAUGHTER</span>. The pretended <i>Greek</i> derivation from σλογω,
which <i>Punch</i> puts in the mouth of the schoolboy, in his

<p id="snob">SNOB, a low, vulgar, or affected person. Supposed to be from

appended in lists to the names of persons of gentle birth,
whilst those who had not that distinction were marked
down as <span class="sc lower">S. NOB.</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>sine nobilitate</i>, without marks of gentility,—thus
reversing its meaning. Another “word-twister”
remarks that, as at college sons of nobleman wrote after
their names in the admission lists, <i>fil nob.</i>, son of a lord, and
hence all young noblemen were called <span class="sc lower">NOBS</span>, and what they

<i>quasi-nobs</i>, “like a nob,” which by a process of contraction
would be shortened to <i>si-nob</i>, and then <span class="sc lower">SNOB</span>, one who pretends
to be what he is not, and apes his betters. The short

March, 1859. Sometimes amplified to <span class="sc lower">STUNNING JOE
BANKS!</span> when the expression is supposed to be in its most
intense form. <span class="sc">Joe Banks</span> was a noted character in the last
generation. He was the proprietor of a public-house in
Dyott-street, Seven Dials, and afterwards, on the demolition
of the Rookery, of another in Cranbourne-alley. His
houses became well-known from their being the resort of
the worst characters, at the same time that the strictest
decorum was always maintained in them. <span class="sc">Joe Banks</span> also
acquired a remarkable notoriety by acting as a medium
betwixt thieves and their victims. Upon the proper
payment to Joe, a watch or a snuff box would at any time
be restored to its lawful owner—“no questions in any case
being asked.” The most daring depredators in London
placed the fullest confidence in Joe, and it is believed
(although the <i>Biographie Universelle</i> is quiet upon this
point) that he never, in any instance, “sold” them. He
was of the middle height, stout, and strongly made, and
was always noted for a showy pin, and a remarkably
<span class="sc lower">STUNNING</span> <i>neck-tie</i>. It was this peculiarity in the costume
of Mr. Banks, coupled with those true and tried qualities
as a friend, for which, as I have just remarked, he was
famous, that led his customers to proclaim him as <span class="sc lower">STUNNING
JOE BANKS!</span> The Marquis of Douro, Colonel Chatterley, and
men of their stamp, were accustomed to resort to a private
room at his house, when too late or too early to gain
admittance to the clubs or more aristocratic establishments.</p>

of the English Bible were a novelty, and who, hearing one
of John Wesley’s preachers mention the <i>swaddling clothes</i>
of the Holy Infant, in a sermon on Christmas-day at Dublin,
shouted out in derision, “<i>A swaddler! a swaddler!</i>” as if
the whole story were the preacher’s invention.—<i>Southey’s
Life of Wesley</i>, vol. ii., p. 109.</p>

broad Scotch pronunciation of Dr. Wallace, one of the
Professors, of the word <i>sweat</i>.—<i>See Notes and Queries</i>, vol. i.,
p. 369.</p>

<p>TAKE IN, a cheating or swindling transaction,—sometimes

<p id="walker">WALKER! or <span class="sc lower">HOOKEY WALKER!</span> an ejaculation of incredulity,
said when a person is telling a story which you know to be
all gammon, or false. The <i>Saturday Reviewer’s</i> explanation
of the phrase is this:—“Years ago, there was a person
named <i>Walker</i>, an aquiline-nosed Jew, who exhibited an
orrery, which he called by the erudite name of <i>Eidouranion</i>.
He was also a popular lecturer on astronomy, and
often invited his pupils, telescope in hand, to <i>take a sight</i>
at the moon and stars. The lecturer’s phrase struck his
school-boy auditory, who frequently “took a sight” with
that gesture of outstretched arm, and adjustment to nose
and eye, which was the first garnish of the popular saying.
The next step was to assume phrase and gesture as the outward
and visible mode of knowingness in general.” A correspondent,
however, denies this, and states that <span class="sc lower">HOOKEY
WALKER</span> was a magistrate of dreaded acuteness and incredulity,
whose hooked nose gave the title of <span class="sc lower">BEAK</span> to all his
successors; and, moreover, that the gesture of applying the
thumb to the nose and agitating the little finger, as an expression
of “Don’t you wish you may get it?” is considerably
older than the story in the <i>Saturday Review</i> would
seem to indicate. There is a third explanation of <span class="sc lower">HOOKEY
WALKER</span> in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, iv., 425.</p>

response. “To <span class="sc lower">WORK</span> a street or neighbourhood,”
trying at each house to sell all one can, or so bawling that

<h2 id="chapter-5">SOME ACCOUNT OF THE BACK SLANG,<br />

<span class="subtitle">THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF COSTERMONGERS.</span></h2>

<p>The costermongers of London number between
thirty and forty thousand. Like other low tribes,
they boast a language, or secret tongue, in which
they hide their earnings, movements, and other
private affairs. This costers’ speech, as Mayhew
remarks, offers no new fact, or approach to a fact,
for philologists; it is not very remarkable for originality
of construction; neither is it spiced with low
humour, as other cant. But the costermongers
boast that it is known only to themselves; that it
is far beyond the Irish, and puzzles the Jews.</p>

<p><i>The main principle of this language is spelling
the words backwards,—or rather, pronouncing them
rudely backwards.</i> Sometimes, for the sake of harmony,
an extra syllable is prefixed, or annexed;
and, occasionally, the word is given quite a different
<a id="page-252" href="#page-252" class="pagenum" title="252"></a>
turn in rendering it backwards, from what an
uninitiated person would have expected. One coster
told Mayhew that he often gave the end of a word
“a new turn, just as if he chorussed it with a tol-de-rol.”
Besides, the coster has his own idea of the
<i>proper</i> way of spelling words, and is not to be convinced
but by an overwhelming show of learning,—and
frequently not then, for he is a very headstrong
fellow. By the time a coster has spelt an
ordinary word of two or three syllables in the proper
way, and then spelt it backwards, it has become a
tangled knot that no etymologist could unravel.
The word <span class="sc lower">GENERALISE</span>, for instance, is considered
to be “shilling” spelt backwards. Sometimes Slang
and Cant words are introduced, and even these,
when imagined to be tolerably well known, are pronounced
backwards. Other terms, such as <span class="sc lower">GEN</span>, a
shilling, and <span class="sc lower">FLATCH</span>, a halfpenny, help to confuse
the outsider.</p>

<p>After a time, this back language, on <span class="sc lower">BACK-SLANG</span>,
as it is called by the costermongers themselves,
comes to be regarded by the rising generation
of street sellers as a distinct and regular mode
of speech. They never refer words, by inverting
them, to their originals; and the <span class="sc lower">YENEPS</span> and <span class="sc lower">ESCLOPS</span>,
and <span class="sc lower">NAMOWS</span>, are looked upon as proper,
but secret terms. “But it is a curious fact, that
lads who become costermongers’ boys, without previous
association with the class, acquire a very ready
<a id="page-253" href="#page-253" class="pagenum" title="253"></a>
command of the language, and this though they
are not only unable to spell, but ‘don’t know a
letter in a book.<a class="marker" id="marker-56" href="#footnote-56"><sup>56</sup></a>’” They soon obtain a considerable
stock vocabulary, so that they converse rather
from the memory than the understanding. Amongst
the senior costermongers, and those who pride
themselves on their proficiency in <span class="sc lower">BACK-SLANG</span>, a
conversation is often sustained for a whole evening,
especially if any “flatties” are present whom they
wish to astonish or confuse. The women use it
sparingly, but the girls are generally well acquainted
with it.</p>

<p>The addition of an <i>s</i>, I should state, always
forms the plural, so that this is another source of
complication. For instance, <i>woman</i> in the <span class="sc lower">BACK-SLANG</span>,
is <span class="sc lower">NAMOW</span>, and <span class="sc lower">NAMUS</span>, or <span class="sc lower">NAMOWS</span>, is
<i>women</i>, not <span class="sc lower">NEMOW</span>. The explorer, then, in undoing
the <span class="sc lower">BACK-SLANG</span>, and turning the word <span class="sc lower">NAMUS</span>
once more into English, would have <i>suman</i>,—a
novel and very extraordinary rendering of <i>women</i>.
Where a word is refractory in submitting to a back
rendering, as in the case of <i>pound</i>, letters are made
to change positions for the sake of harmony;
thus, we have <span class="sc lower">DUNOP</span>, a pound, instead of <i>dnuop</i>
which nobody could pleasantly pronounce. This
will remind the reader of the Jews’ “<i>old clo! old
clo!</i>” instead of <i>old clothes, old clothes</i>, which would
tire even the patience of a Jew to repeat all day.</p>
<a id="page-254" href="#page-254" class="pagenum" title="254"></a>

<p>This singular <span class="sc lower">BACK</span> tongue has been in vogue
about twenty-five years. It is, as before stated,
soon acquired, and is principally used by the costermongers
(as the specimen Glossary will show), for
communicating the secrets of their street tradings,
the cost and profit of the goods, and for keeping
their natural enemies, the police, in the dark. <span class="sc">Cool
the esclop</span> (look at the police) is often said
amongst them, when one of the constabulary makes
his appearance.</p>

<p>Perhaps on no subject is the costermonger so particular
as on money matters. All costs and profits
he thinks should be kept profoundly secret. The
Back Slang, therefore, gives the various small
amounts very minutely.</p>

<ul>
  <li>FLATCH, halfpenny.</li>
  <li>YENEP, penny.</li>
  <li>OWT-YENEPS, twopence.</li>
  <li>ERTH-YENEPS, threepence.</li>
  <li>ROUF-YENEPS, fourpence.</li>
  <li>EVIF, or EWIF-YENEPS, fivepence.</li>
  <li>EXIS-YENEPS, sixpence.</li>
  <li>NEVIS-YENEPS, sevenpence.</li>
  <li>TEAICH, or THEG-YENEPS, eightpence.</li>
  <li>ENIN-YENEPS, ninepence.</li>
  <li>NET-YENEPS, tenpence.</li>
  <li>NEVELÉ-YENEPS, elevenpence.</li>
  <li>EVLÉNET-YENNEPS, twelvepence.</li>
  <li>GEN, or GENERALIZE, one shilling, or twelvepence.</li>
  <li>YENEP-FLATCH, three halfpence.</li>
  <li><a id="page-255" href="#page-255" class="pagenum" title="255"></a>OWT-YENEP-FLATCH, twopence halfpenny. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</li>
  <li>GEN, or ENO-GEN, one shilling.</li>
  <li>OWT-GENS, two shillings.</li>
  <li>ERTH-GENS, three shillings.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <span class="sc lower">GENS</span> continue in the same sequence as the
<span class="sc lower">YENEPS</span> above, excepting <span class="sc lower">THEG-GENS</span>, 8s., which is
usually rendered <span class="sc lower">THEG-GUY</span>,—a deviation with
ample precedents in all civilised tongues.</p>

<ul>
  <li>YENORK, a crown piece, or five shillings.</li>
  <li>FLATCH-YENORK, half-a-crown.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond this amount the costermonger reckons
after an intricate and complicated mode. Fifteen
shillings would be <span class="sc lower">ERTH-EVIF-GENS</span>, or, literally,
three times 5s.; seventeen shillings would be <span class="sc lower">ERTH-YENORK-FLATCH</span>,
or three crowns and a half; or,
by another mode of reckoning, <span class="sc lower">ERTH-EVIF-GENS
FLATCH-YENORK</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, three times 5s., and half-a-crown.</p>

<ul>
  <li>DUNOP, a pound.</li>
</ul>

<p>Further than which the costermonger seldom goes
in money reckoning.</p>

<p>In the following Glossary only those words are
given which costermongers principally use,—the
terms connected with street traffic, the names of the
different coins, vegetables, fruit and fish, technicalities
of police courts, &amp;c.</p>
<a id="page-256" href="#page-256" class="pagenum" title="256"></a>

<p>The reader might naturally think that a system
of speech so simple as the <span class="sc lower">BACK-SLANG</span> would require
no Glossary; but he will quickly perceive,
from the specimens given, that a great many words
in frequent use in a <span class="sc lower">BACK</span> sense, have become so
twisted as to require a little glossarial explanation.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-7">SOME ACCOUNT OF THE RHYMING SLANG,<br />

<span class="subtitle">THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF CHAUNTERS AND PATTERERS.</span></h2>

<p>There exists in London a singular tribe of men,
known amongst the “fraternity of vagabonds” as
Chaunters and Patterers. Both classes are great
talkers. The first sing or chaunt through the public
thoroughfares ballads—political and humorous—carols,
dying speeches, and the various other kinds
of gallows and street literature. The second deliver
street orations on grease-removing compounds,
plating powders, high polishing blacking, and the
thousand and one wonderful pennyworths that are
retailed to gaping mobs from a London kerb stone.</p>

<p>They are quite a distinct tribe from the costermongers;
indeed, amongst tramps, they term themselves
the “harristocrats of the streets,” and boast
that they live by their intellects. Like the costermongers,
<a id="page-264" href="#page-264" class="pagenum" title="264"></a>
however, they have a secret tongue or
Cant speech, known only to each other. This Cant,
which has nothing to do with that spoken by the
costermongers, is known in Seven Dials and elsewhere
as the <span class="sc lower">RHYMING SLANG</span>, <i>or the substitution
of words and sentences which rhyme with other
words intended to be kept secret</i>. The chaunter’s
Cant, therefore, partakes of his calling, and he
transforms and uses up into a rough speech the
various odds and ends of old songs, ballads, and
street nick-names, which are found suitable to his
purpose. Unlike nearly all other systems of Cant,
the rhyming Slang is not founded upon allegory;
unless we except a few rude similes, thus—<span class="sc lower">I’M
AFLOAT</span> is the rhyming Cant for <i>boat</i>, <span class="sc lower">SORROWFUL
TALE</span> is equivalent to <i>three months in jail</i>, <span class="sc lower">ARTFUL
DODGER</span> signifies a <i>lodger</i>, and a <span class="sc lower">SNAKE IN THE
GRASS</span> stands for a <i>looking-glass</i>—a meaning that
would delight a fat Chinaman, or a Collector of
Oriental proverbs. But, as in the case of the
costers’ speech and the old gipsey-vagabond Cant,
the chaunters and patterers so interlard this rhyming
Slang with their general remarks, while their ordinary
language is so smothered and subdued, that,
unless when they are professionally engaged and
talking of their wares, they might almost pass for
foreigners.</p>

<p>From the inquiries I have made of various
patterers and “paper workers,” I learn that the
<a id="page-265" href="#page-265" class="pagenum" title="265"></a>
rhyming Slang was introduced about twelve or
fifteen years ago. Numbering this class of oratorical
and bawling wanderers at twenty thousand,
scattered over Great Britain, including London
and the large provincial towns, we thus see the
number of English vagabonds who converse in
rhyme and talk poetry, although their habitations
and mode of life constitute a very unpleasant
Arcadia. These nomadic poets, like the other
talkers of Cant or secret languages, are stamped
with the vagabond’s mark, and are continually on
the move. The married men mostly have lodgings
in London, and come and go as occasion may
require. A few never quit London streets, but the
greater number tramp to all the large provincial
fairs, and prefer the <span class="sc lower">MONKERY</span> (country) to town
life. Some transact their business in a systematic
way, sending a post-office order to the Seven Dials
printer, for a fresh supply of ballads or penny
books, or to the <span class="sc lower">SWAG SHOP</span>, as the case may be,
for trinkets and gewgaws, to be sent on by rail to
a given town by the time they shall arrive there.</p>

<p>When any dreadful murder, colliery explosion,
or frightful railway accident has happened in a
country district, three or four chaunters are generally
on the spot in a day or two after the occurrence,
vending and bawling “<i>A True and Faithful
Account</i>,” &amp;c., which “true and faithful account”
was concocted purely in the imaginations of the
<a id="page-266" href="#page-266" class="pagenum" title="266"></a>
successors of Catnach and Tommy Pitts,<a class="marker" id="marker-58" href="#footnote-58"><sup>58</sup></a> behind
the counters of their printing shops in Seven Dials.
And but few fairs are held in any part of England
without the patterer being punctually at his post,
with his nostrums, or real gold rings (with the story
of the wager laid by the gentleman—see
<span class="sc lower"><a href="#fawney-bouncing">FAWNEY BOUNCING</a></span>,
in the Dictionary), or save-alls for
candlesticks, or paste which, when applied to the
strop, makes the dullest razor keen enough to hack
broom handles and sticks, and after that to have
quite enough sharpness left for splitting hairs, or
shaving them off the back of one of the clodhoppers’
hands, looking on in amazement. And
<span class="sc lower">CHEAP JOHN</span>, too, with his coarse jokes, and no
end of six-bladed knives, and pocket-books, containing
information for everybody, with pockets to
hold money, and a pencil to write with in the
bargain, and a van stuffed with the cheap productions
of Sheffield and “Brummagem,”—he, too, is
a patterer of the highest order, and visits fairs, and
can hold a conversation in the rhyming Slang.</p>

<p>Such is a rough description of the men who
speak this jargon; and simple and ridiculous as
the vulgar scheme of a rhyming Slang may appear,
it must always be regarded as a curious fact in
linguistic history. In order that the reader’s
patience may not be too much taxed, only a
<a id="page-267" href="#page-267" class="pagenum" title="267"></a>
selection of rhyming words has been given in the
Glossary,—and these for the most part, as in the
case of the back Slang, are the terms of everyday
life, as used by this order of tramps and hucksters.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that the
chaunter or patterer confines himself entirely to
this Slang when conveying secret intelligence. On
the contrary, although he speaks not a “leash of
languages,” yet is he master of the beggars’ Cant,
and is thoroughly “up” in street Slang. The following
letter, written by a chaunter to a gentleman
who took an interest in his welfare, will show his
capabilities in this line.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="salutation">

<h2 id="chapter-9">THE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF SLANG, CANT, AND VULGAR LANGUAGE;<br />

<span class="subtitle">OR A LIST OF THE BOOKS WHICH HAVE BEEN
CONSULTED IN COMPILING THIS WORK, COMPRISING NEARLY EVERY KNOWN
TREATISE UPON THE SUBJECT.</span></h2>

<p>Slang has a literary history, the same as authorised
language. More than one hundred works have
treated upon the subject in one form or another,—a
few devoting but a chapter, whilst many have
given up their entire pages to expounding its history
and use. Old Harman, a worthy man, who
interested himself in suppressing and exposing
vagabondism in the days of good Queen Bess, was
the first to write upon the subject. Decker followed
fifty years afterwards, but helped himself,
evidently, to his predecessor’s labours. Shakespere,
Beaumont and Fletcher, Ben Jonson, and Brome,
each employed beggars’ Cant as part of the machinery
of their plays. Then came Head (who
wrote “The English Rogue,” in 1680) with a
<a id="page-276" href="#page-276" class="pagenum" title="276"></a>
glossary of Cant words “used by the Gipseys.”
But it was only a reprint of what Decker had
given sixty years before. About this time authorised
dictionaries began to insert vulgar words,
labelling them “Cant.” The Jack Sheppards and
Dick Turpins of the early and middle part of the
last century made Cant popular, and many small
works were published upon the subject. But it
was Grose, burly, facetious Grose, who, in the year
1785, collected the scattered glossaries of Cant and
secret words, and formed one large work, adding
to it all the vulgar words and Slang terms used in
his own day. I am aware that the indelicacy and
extreme vulgarity of the work renders it a disgrace
to its compiler, still we must admit that it is
by far the most important work which has ever
appeared on street or popular language; indeed,
from its pages every succeeding work has, up to
the present time, drawn its contents. The great
fault of Grose’s book consists in the author not
contenting himself with Slang and Cant terms, but
the inserting of every “smutty” and offensive word
that could be raked out of the gutters of the streets.
However, Harman and Grose are, after all, the
only authors who have as yet treated the subject in
an original manner, or have written on it from
personal inquiry.</p>

the antiquity of popular or street language. Many words, owing

LIBER VAGATORUM: Der Betler Orden, 4to.
  </p>
  <p class="biblio-description">
The first edition of this book appears to have been printed at
Augsburg, by Erhard Öglin, or Ocellus, about 1514,—a small
quarto of twelve leaves. It was frequently reprinted at other
places in Germany; and in 1528 there appeared an edition at
Wittemberg, with a preface by Martin Luther, who says that the
“Rotwelsche Sprach,” the cant language of the beggars, comes
from the Jews, as it contains many Hebrew words, as anyone who
understands that language may perceive. This book is divided
into three parts, or sections; the first gives a special account of
the several orders of the “Fraternity of Vagabonds;” the second,
sundry “<i>notabilia</i>” relating to the different classes of beggars
previously described; and the third consists of a “Rotwelsche
Vocabulary,” or “Canting Dictionary.” There is a long notice of
the “Liber Vagatorum” in the “Wiemarisches Jahrbuch,” 10<sup>te</sup>,
Band, 1856. Mayhew, in his “London Labour,” states that many
of our cant words are derived from the Jew fences. It is singular
that a similar statement should have been made by Martin Luther
more than three centuries before.

<h3>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>“The author has spared no pains to make his little volume perfect, both by
collecting original and unused material from costermongers, vagabonds, and
tramps, and by consulting nearly all writers who have gone before. * * *
The author divides <span class="sc">Slang</span> into <i>historical</i>, <i>fashionable</i>, <i>parliamentary</i>, <i>military
and dandy</i>, <i>university</i>, <i>religious</i>, <i>legal</i>, <i>literary</i>, <i>theatrical</i>, <i>civic</i>, <i>money</i>,
<i>shopkeepers’ and workmen’s slang</i>,—the <i>slang apologies for oaths</i>, and the <i>slang
of drunkenness</i>. The Freemasonry of tramps and beggars, and the hieroglyphics
they use, is an interesting part of vagabond history that requires, if
possible, further investigation. * * * His work is carefully and honestly
performed, and we hope that the writer will read our remarks [five full
columns] in a proper spirit, and, in the latest slang of the present hour, will
“<span class="sc lower">TAKE THEM ON HIS HEAD LIKE A BIRD</span>.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>“Extremely interesting. This little volume is evidently the result of a
great deal of labour, as all works must be that are, in the chief part, collected
directly by the observation and care of the author: and this we believe is the
case in the present instance. The author we suspect to be identical with the
publisher, and if so, he has had great opportunity by his possession of a large
amount of scarce tracts, ballads, and street publications, of informing himself
of the language of the vagabond portion of our population.”—<i>Leader.</i></p>

<p><a id="page-294" href="#page-294" class="pagenum" title="294"></a>
“There is a certain amount of interest in preserving the origin of slang
words as a record of existing manners, and of those strange popular sayings
which have a rapid and almost universal popularity, and then fade away as
rapidly. The combinations of language in cant are often curious. The
London Antiquary informs us that the cant for a public house at the present
day is <i>suck cassa</i>,—pure Saxon and pure Spanish.”—<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>“This is by far the most complete work upon a curious subject which has
yet been compiled—a dictionary of more than three thousand words in current
use in our streets and alleys, lanes and by-ways, from which the learned
lexicographers have turned aside with contempt.”—<i>Critic.</i></p>

<p>“This new Dictionary of our English cant and slang is <i>full</i>, and may be
received as an amusing and suggestive little book of common knowledge into
any household. Indecency has been omitted from its pages.”—<i>Examiner.</i></p>

<p>“The ‘London Antiquary’ has certainly taken up a very curious and interesting

<span class="larger">☞</span> There is an edition of this work extant, hastily got up after my own

It gives an introduction, long and occasionally amusing, but of not the least
value in explaining to the <i>English</i> reader the peculiarities of the work. The
<i>Globe</i> pointed out this sad defect in reviewing the present edition:—“The
copy beside us,” remarks the writer, “is apparently edited and published by
Mr. Hotten, who gives a preface—which has the rare merit of explaining
exactly what the ordinary English reader requires to know of satirical political
poems, written in the Yankee dialect, touching the Mexican war, and the
extension of the slave states—and of attempting to explain nothing else.”—<i>Globe</i>,

<p>“A brilliant sketch of the great historian, containing particulars of his
youthful compositions, which are new and deeply interesting.”—<i>Herald.</i></p>

<p>“We regard the little work before us as a very opportune publication.
The author has brought together such a mass of facts, sketches, and anecdotes,
illustrative of the character and mind of Lord Macaulay, that the
book is very valuable as supplying, in a small compass, a faithful and vivid
account of the great historian.”—<i>Bradford Review.</i></p>

the extraordinary capacity and availability of his memory many wonderful
stories are told.”<!--TN: added closing quotation mark-->—<i>Evangelical Repository.</i></p>

<p>“This work is well timed. Here we really have all that is known concerning
the great man. The little book brings together with much dexterity
and success very various and very scattered materials. We have been
peculiarly interested in the details of the late illustrious Baron’s youthful
productions. Never before has Wordsworth’s famous couplet, “The boy is
father of the man,” received so vivid illustration. It is earnestly to be hoped
that the whole of these early papers, and his inedited speeches and addresses
written and spoken in the flush of his powers, and with all the wealth of
illustration that so distinguished him, shall be collected. Why not at once
by the writer of the present brilliant sketch? We know not who he is, but
he is a man of no common powers. He has evidently, too, put his heart into
his book. It thrills and throbs with reverent love towards the man. We
like exceedingly his fresh, generous, glowing style; and not less his genial,
gossipy way of telling the many anecdotes with which his pages sparkle.”—<i>Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>“Valuable from the original matter and anecdotes it gives concerning
Macaulay’s youthful productions.”—<i>Leader.</i></p>

<p>It is well known that the unfortunate regulation imposed by Pepys, the

in the year 1528. <span class="sc">Now first Translated into English, with Notes</span>,
by JOHN CAMDEN HOTTEN.
</p>

<p>⁂ This very singular work is comparatively unknown in this country.
The first edition appears to have been printed at Augsburg, by Erhard Öglin,
or Ocellus, as early as 1514—a small quarto of twelve leaves. It was frequently
reprinted at other places in Germany; and in 1528 there appeared an edition
at Wittemberg, with a Preface by Martin Luther, from which the present
translation has been made. The work is divided into three parts or sections;
the first gives a special account of the several orders of the “Fraternity of
Vagabonds;” the second, sundry <i>notabilia</i> relating to the different classes of
beggars previously described; and the third consists of a <span class="sc">Canting Dictionary</span>.
It is singular that more than three centuries ago Martin Luther
should have declared that the cant language of beggars comes from the
Hebrews, and that in our own time a similar statement should be made by
Mayhew in his <i>London Labour</i>. Mayhew says that many of the most expressive
street terms in every day use by London and provincial vagabonds are derived
from the Jew <i>Fences</i>.</p>
